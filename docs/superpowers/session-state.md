# CCG Session State

> Full context for resuming work. Kept in the project so it travels with the repo.

## What we're building

An online 1v1 collectible card game (Hearthstone-clone for initial scope). Features: ranked PvP matchmaking (MMR-based), spectatable game sessions, full accounts + card collection system, authoritative server (client is a pure event renderer). Target scale: 1k–10k concurrent players.

---

## Architecture (locked)

**Core Split** — two services + one client:

| Component | Stack | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Game Server | C# / .NET (ASP.NET Core) | Authoritative game state, WebSocket connections, action processing, event broadcasting |
| Platform API | TypeScript / Node.js | Auth, card collection, deck management, matchmaking, MMR |
| Client | Unity or Godot (TBD) | Renders events, sends player actions |

**Shared logic:** `CCG.GameLogic` — standalone C# class library (no engine/framework deps). Referenced by Game Server; optionally by Unity client.

**Storage:** PostgreSQL (persistent) + Redis (ephemeral queue/session state).

---

## Subsystem build order

| # | Subsystem | Service |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Game Server | C# / .NET |
| 2 | Auth & Accounts | Platform API |
| 3 | Collection & Decks | Platform API |
| 4 | Matchmaking | Platform API |
| 5 | Client | Unity / Godot |

## Where we stopped

**Game Mechanics spec is COMPLETE and approved** — all 4 sections written to `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-26-game-mechanics.md` (data model, actions/events, engine architecture, action pipeline).

**Implementation plan is COMPLETE** — broken into 16 epics with ~80 tickets under `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-ccg-game-logic/`. Start at the README there; it has the full epic index, ticket outline, and a writing-progress tracker. Each ticket is a small, testable increment using the scenario-test methodology (build state → submit action(s) → assert ordered events + state).

**Next steps when resuming:**
1. Read `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-ccg-game-logic/README.md` for the plan structure
2. Begin implementation at **Epic 01 / T1.1** (project scaffold). The user picks up tickets one at a time and implements them collaboratively — do NOT auto-implement the whole thing.
3. Use git: this repo was `git init`'d; the game-mechanics spec is committed. Commit after each ticket.

**Key decisions locked during planning:**
- .NET 8, xUnit + FluentAssertions; records for actions/events, classes for state.
- `GameEngine.Submit(action)` returns the full event list; `EventBus` is independently inspectable.
- Trigger fire order = current player first, then by **board index at publish time** (not summonOrder, though summonOrder is kept for disambiguation).
- Death wave: Phase 1 remove → Phase 2 deathrattles → Phase 3 reborn; new deaths deferred to next wave.

## Decided feature scope (locked in brainstorming)

### Card types
All four: **Minion, Spell, Weapon, Hero Power**. Hero/class is tied to the deck (like Hearthstone).

### Keywords (all selected, system must be extensible)
Taunt, Divine Shield, Charge, Rush, Lifesteal, Windfury, Poisonous, Stealth, Spell Damage +X, Reborn, Enrage, Freeze — plus any future keywords added via new `IKeyword` implementations.

### Trigger types (all selected, system must be extensible)
Battlecry, Deathrattle, Start of Turn, End of Turn, Aura (continuous), On Damage Taken, On Friendly Minion Death, On Spell Cast, Inspire, Combo, On Invert — plus any future triggers added via new `ITrigger` implementations.

### Inversion mechanic
- A card or minion can be in **Normal** or **Inverted** state
- Stats flip: Attack ↔ Health when inverted
- Trigger type can change: e.g. Battlecry → Deathrattle when inverted
- Effects are individually defined per card (normal and inverted sections in definition JSON)
- Reversible (can be inverted and un-inverted multiple times)
- Applies to cards in hand AND minions on board
- Triggered by: card effect/spell, player-initiated action, on draw/zone entry, opponent action

### Choice / interactive mechanics
- **Mulligan** — pre-game hand selection
- **Discover** — present 3 options, player picks 1
- **Mid-effect targeting** — pause mid-resolution for player to select a target
- **Card crafting** — multi-step interactive sequence producing a custom card
All require a `PendingChoice` game phase.

### Intervention system
When an opponent declares an action, the other player gets a **single-response window** (play one card / skip) before the action resolves. Exact trigger conditions TBD in Game Server spec. Requires `PendingIntervention` game phase.

### Neutral zone
- Third board zone between the two player boards — neither player owns it
- Neutral minions have no turn of their own
- Players can: attack neutral minions, command them to attack, mind control them
- Taunt keyword is **ignored** for neutral minions
- Player auras do **not** affect neutral minions
- Neutral minions enter via: card effect, pre-populated at game start, event trigger
- Zone has a **max capacity** and may **repopulate on turn start** (configured per game mode)

### Architecture pattern
**Event Bus + Component System** — Actions (Commands) → Events → State updates.
- New keyword = new `IKeyword` class
- New trigger = new `ITrigger` class
- New effect = new `IEffect` class
- Custom card logic = new `ICardHandler` that registers triggers into the bus
- Auras = `IAura` recalculated after every board change

## Approved data model (Section 1 — approved)

### GameState
```
sessionId: string
player1: PlayerState
player2: PlayerState
neutralZone: MinionOnBoard[]          // ownerId = null; Taunt ignored; auras don't apply
neutralZoneConfig: NeutralZoneConfig? // null = no neutral zone this game mode
turn: TurnState
timer: TimerState
phase: GamePhase                      // Mulligan | WaitingForPlayers | InProgress | PendingChoice | PendingIntervention | Ended
winnerId?: string

```

### Card
```

HeroPower       — cardId: string, manaCost: int, definition: JsonElement, handlerKey?: string
