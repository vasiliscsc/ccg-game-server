# Old Unity Project — Borrow List for `CCG.GameLogic` Spec

**Date:** 2026-05-28
**Source:** `C:\Users\vasil\UnityProjects\ccg` — earlier proof-of-concept implementation.
**Purpose:** Discrete items to discuss one at a time. For each: what's there, what it would add to our spec, recommendation, open questions. Items the new spec already covers (per-zone collections, Phase 1/2/3 death wave, trigger ordering by active player + board index, scenario test Spine/Exact traces, EntityId-style typed IDs, DeathProcessor/Service split) are deliberately omitted.

Items are roughly ordered by impact on the spec, not by topic.

## Item 1 — Stabilization loop iteration cap & explicit wave events

**What the old project does:**
The `Stabilize` method in `PlayCardResolver` (PlayCardResolver.cs:62–92) runs an outer loop that processes triggers, then a death wave, then re-checks for new events, until no new events appear. **No iteration cap. No wave-start/wave-end markers.** Relies on the assumption that "effects eventually stop creating new events."

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Our spec §4 ⑦ describes the death-wave loop and says "back to step 1 (next wave)" but doesn't say what stops a runaway. A card designer could write something that loops indefinitely (e.g., deathrattle summons a 1/0 minion → dies → triggers itself → infinite). Right now nothing in the spec prevents this. Also: clients and tests have no signal for "the cascade just settled" — they have to infer it from event-list quiescence.

**Recommendation: Adopt.** Two small additions to §4 ⑦:
1. **Iteration cap:** define a `GameConstants.MaxDeathWaves` (e.g. 32). On exceeding, abort the action, roll back, emit a `StabilizationAbortedEvent`. Forces designers to think about termination; protects production.
2. **Wave markers:** emit `DeathWaveStartedEvent { waveIndex }` and `DeathWaveEndedEvent { waveIndex, minionsResolved }`. Cheap, audit-friendly, and the client can use them to gate animations.

**Open questions:**
- Cap value — 32 feels generous; what's reasonable?
- Should `StabilizationAbortedEvent` end the game, or just reject the action?

### ✅ DECISION (2026-05-29): ADOPTED, adapted

- **Cap = 16** (not 32). It's a runaway *detector*, not a budget — set just above legitimate worst case. Named constant `GameConstants.MaxDeathWaves`.
- **Cap trip → abort the match as `NoContest`** (not a draw — would unfairly hit MMR; not reject+rollback — rollback restores the exact state the bug re-triggers from, so the player could just replay it into the same hang). Publish `StabilizationAbortedEvent` then `GameEndedEvent { reason: NoContest }`, set `phase = Ended`. No rollback/snapshot dependency.
- **Wave markers adopted:** `DeathWaveStartedEvent { waveIndex }` / `DeathWaveEndedEvent { waveIndex, minionsResolved }`.
- **`reason: NoContest`** added to `GameEndedEvent`.
- **Telemetry = `StabilizationAbortReport { rngSeed, preActionState, triggeringAction, wavesReached, cascadeTrace[] }`** — formatted to drop straight into a scenario fixture (Build/Script/Assert) so the runaway is reproduced and the abort never regresses.
- **Reborn confirmed non-looping** (self-consuming in Phase 3) — discussed and ruled out as a loop source; runaway is always Phase 2 deathrattle/summon-driven.
- **Reborn keyword vs. charge split (related amendment, 2026-05-29):** the Reborn *keyword* is a persistent tag (counts for auras, survives bounce/copy, only Silence clears it); the one-time reborn *charge* is separate, modeled as `MinionOnBoard.rebornAvailable: bool`. Reborn firing consumes the bool, NOT the keyword. Charge initializes at summon to `keywords.Contains("reborn")`; the reborn-summon path summons with it false; a *copy* of a spent reborn minion is a fresh summon → charge re-initializes true. Considered a generic charge-container (`Dictionary<string,int>` + `IKeyword.InitialCharges`) but chose the bool (YAGNI — population of one, no other charge mechanics planned; trivially refactorable later). Spec amended: §1 `MinionOnBoard`, §3 Reborn keyword row, §4 ⑦ Phase 3.
- Real fix is upstream content validation at card-load time; runtime cap is the backstop (termination is undecidable).

Spec amended: §2B (events), §4 ⑦ (Death Resolution rewritten).

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 04 T4.5** (`DeathResolutionService` wave loop) — add `GameConstants.MaxDeathWaves = 16`, `DeathWaveStartedEvent`/`DeathWaveEndedEvent`, and the abort path (`StabilizationAbortedEvent` → `GameEndedEvent{NoContest}` → `phase=Ended`; no rollback).
- **Epic 04 T4.1** (`MinionOnBoard`) — add `rebornAvailable: bool`.
- **Epic 03 T3.5** (`GameEndedEvent` / win check) — add `NoContest` reason.
- **Epic 08 T8.5** (Reborn / Phase 3) — REWRITE: consume `rebornAvailable`, **keep** the keyword; reborn-summon path sets `rebornAvailable=false`; a copy re-initializes it from the keyword. (Current ticket text says "reborn removed" — wrong under the new model.)
- **NEW ticket needed** (no telemetry concept in the plan) — `StabilizationAbortReport` sink + scenario-reproducible report (`rngSeed`/`preActionState`/`triggeringAction`/`wavesReached`/`cascadeTrace`). Suggest Epic 04 **T4.8** (depends on Item 6 `IRandom` for `rngSeed`).

---

## Item 2 — Pre-built `ITriggerCondition` singletons (composable filters)

**What the old project does:**
`ITriggerCondition` (ITriggerCondition.cs:6–45) has a single `Matches(...)` method. Four pre-built singletons exist: `AlwaysCondition`, `SelfIsRelatedEntityCondition` ("the dying minion is me"), `FriendlyRelatedEntityCondition`, `EnemyRelatedEntityCondition`. Card definitions reference these by reference, not by string. No allocation per check, no JSON DSL.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Our spec defines `ITrigger.ShouldFire(GameEvent, GameState)` (§3) as an open method. Card definitions go through `definition: JsonElement` (Section 1). The implication is that every card with a trigger writes its own predicate logic — which is fine for unique cards, but the 80/20 case ("fire only on friendly minion death," "fire only when self is the source") will repeat across dozens of cards. Without canned conditions, every card author re-implements those filters and we lose a regression-test target.

**Recommendation: Adopt.** Define a small library of `ITriggerCondition` building blocks in the spec under §3:
- `AlwaysFires`
- `SelfIsSource` / `SelfIsTarget` / `SelfIsRelated`
- `FriendlyOnly` / `EnemyOnly` (by ownerId vs trigger source's owner)
- `MinionTypeIs(string definitionKey)` (for tribal triggers)

`ITrigger` implementations compose one or more of these via `And`/`Or` combinators. `DefaultCardHandler` reads `definition.condition` JSON (e.g. `"FriendlyMinionDeath"`) and maps to a canned condition; custom cards still implement `ITrigger` directly.

**Open questions:**
- Should this live in the spec or be left as an implementation detail of `DefaultCardHandler`? Putting it in the spec gives every card the same vocabulary.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-05-30): ADOPTED, in the spec

- **`ITriggerCondition` added to §3** as a first-class interface — `bool Matches(GameEvent evt, GameState state, string sourceId)`. `sourceId` is the trigger's host entity; conditions evaluate the event relative to it. `ITrigger.ShouldFire` typically delegates to a condition (or tree).
- **Single-condition library, two shapes:**
  - *Parameterless singletons:* `AlwaysFires`, `SelfIsSource`, `SelfIsTarget`, `SelfIsRelated`, `FriendlyOnly`, `EnemyOnly`.
  - *Parameterized factories:* `MinionTypeIs(definitionKey)`, `CardTypeIs(CardType)`, `CostAtLeast(n)`/`CostAtMost(n)`. (The parameterized shape was surfaced by the user's "2-mana-or-higher spell" example — a numeric threshold predicate that the flat-singleton list would have missed.)
- **Combinators adopted:** `All` (AND) / `Any` (OR), nestable. Rated low-effort/high-leverage: the combinator *classes* are trivial (~6 lines, `All`/`Any` over children); the only real (still small) work is the recursive JSON descent in `DefaultCardHandler`, which the compound-condition requirement forces regardless of whether it's called a "combinator." `Not` deliberately deferred (same shape, add on first need — e.g. "other friendly minion died").
- **Multiplicity confirmed as an orthogonal axis.** A card = handler = N triggers (the spec already supported this via "ICardHandler registers triggers, plural"); now made explicit with a `definition.triggers` array. Combinators compose conditions *within* one trigger; multiple effects watching different events are *separate* triggers. The user's two-line example (summon-on-spell + draw-on-beast-death) exercises both axes at once and is embedded in the spec as the worked example.
- **Battlecry / Deathrattle confirmed to fit the same `{ type, condition, effect }` shape** (Battlecry = `MinionPlayed`+`SelfIsSource`; Deathrattle = `MinionDied`+`SelfIsRelated`). Key clarification recorded in spec: **conditions gate (*whether*), trigger `type` routes (*when/in what order*).** Battlecry resolves synchronously in the PlayCard pipeline (may pause for targeting); Deathrattle resolves in death-wave Phase 2 off the death snapshot — neither fires at raw publish time. The condition library does not alter these resolution semantics (§4 owns them).
- **JSON encoding of the condition tree left as `DefaultCardHandler` implementation detail** — explicitly out of the spec; settles when the first compound card is authored.

Resolved the open question above (spec vs. impl detail): **the interface + library + combinators go in the spec** (shared vocabulary, shared test target); only the wire encoding stays in the handler.

Spec amended: §3 (`ITrigger` cross-reference + new `ITriggerCondition` subsection).

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 08 T8.1** (`ICardHandler` + `ITrigger` infra + `DefaultCardHandler`) — add `Interfaces/ITriggerCondition.cs`, the single-condition library (parameterless singletons + parameterized factories), and `All`/`Any` combinators; introduce the `definition.triggers[]` array and the `DefaultCardHandler` JSON→condition mapping. T8.1 is already dense — recommend splitting the condition library into a **NEW ticket T8.10** (`ITriggerCondition` library + combinators, with its own unit tests as the shared regression target).
- **Epic 08 T8.6 / T8.8** (Start-of-turn / On-Friendly-Death) — restate their `ShouldFire` predicates as conditions (`FriendlyOnly`, `Not(SelfIsRelated)`, etc.) rather than ad-hoc inline checks; note `Not` is added here on first need.

---

## Item 3 — Snapshot triggers before processing (registration-during-cascade safety)

**What the old project does:**
`TriggerProcessor` (TriggerProcessor.cs:65–107) **snapshots the trigger list at the start of an event batch.** Triggers registered mid-cascade (e.g. a deathrattle that summons a minion with its own trigger) do **not** fire on events already in flight — they only catch *subsequent* events in the next batch.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Our spec §3 `IEventBus` says "publish ordering — current player's list first, then opponent's; sorted by current board index at publish time." It doesn't say *what list*: the live subscriber list at the moment of publish, or a snapshot taken at the start of the publish batch. These differ exactly when a trigger handler installs a new trigger while the bus is iterating. Worth being explicit in the spec.

**Recommendation: Adopt and document.** Add a sentence to §3 `IEventBus`: *"Subscribers for a given event are snapshotted at publish time. Listeners registered during dispatch of that event do not receive it; they receive subsequent publishes only."* Same applies during the death-wave Phase 2 — new triggers from reborn minions don't retroactively fire on deaths already published this wave.

**Open questions:**
- Does the spec want the snapshot at *individual event publish* or at *action-handler batch start*? Different answer for "does an event fired during the action see triggers from a minion summoned earlier in the same action."

### ✅ DECISION (2026-05-31): ADOPTED — per-event snapshot + creation-epoch filter

Chose **per-event snapshot at publish time, plus a creation-epoch visibility filter** — which delivers the old project's "registered mid-cascade → subsequent events only" behavior (and Hearthstone's "a new minion never triggers off the event that introduced it") *uniformly*, without the heavier per-batch threading.

- **Mechanism:** `GameEngine` keeps a monotonic `currentActionEpoch`, incremented as each action enters stage ④. Subscribers are stamped `birthEpoch`; events are stamped `originEpoch`; `Publish(E)` dispatches to listener `L` iff `L.birthEpoch < E.originEpoch`. Equal epoch → excluded, so a listener never sees events from the action that created it (incl. its own `MinionSummonedEvent`).
- **Why epoch over per-batch threading** (resolves the open question — chose per-event, not per-batch): same observable behavior, but per-batch threading is *heavy* — it copies the subscriber registry per action, leaks a "batch" concept into the `IEventBus` contract (extra param or `BeginBatch`/`EndBatch` ambient state), introduces temporal coupling (pairing must survive the stabilization-abort tear-down), forces a batch-boundary definition (action vs. wave vs. cascade) that is itself a bug surface, and is non-local to debug. Epoch is a pointwise integer compare on the *live* list: lighter **and** strictly more robust (no stale frozen list can fire a removed subscriber; no intra-handler ordering dependency). Rejected the earlier "register-after-own-summon-event" deferral idea too — it was ad-hoc per event type (fragile); epoch is uniform.
- **Robustness driver (the deciding factor):** new entity-introducing events (transform, resurrect, copy, …) are covered by the *same* rule with zero extra code, vs. the deferral approach where each must individually replicate the ritual or silently misbehave.
- **Supporting invariant added to spec:** *all bus subscriptions happen inside action handlers* (stage ④ — `OnSummon`, `IKeyword.OnApplied`); nothing subscribes during publish (⑤) or aura recalc (⑥). This is what makes the epoch comparison total.

Spec amended: §2B (event base gains `originEpoch`), §3 `IEventBus` (snapshot + epoch rule + invariant) and Deterministic Ordering table (new row), §4 ④ (epoch increment + stamping), §4 ⑤ (snapshot + filter on publish), §4 ⑦ Phase 2 (death-wave cross-reference).

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 01 T1.3** (`GameEvent` base) — add `originEpoch: int` alongside `OccurredAt`.
- **Epic 01 T1.4** (`IEventBus` interface) — subscribers carry a `birthEpoch`; document the epoch contract.
- **Epic 01 T1.5** (`EventBus` impl) — snapshot subscriber lists at publish + filter by `birthEpoch < originEpoch`; add an epoch-visibility scenario test (a listener does not receive the event from the action that created it). Folds naturally into the existing ordering tests.
- **Epic 01 T1.8** (`GameEngine` pipeline) — maintain `currentActionEpoch`, increment as each action enters stage ④, stamp returned events' `originEpoch` and new subscriptions' `birthEpoch`.

## Item 4 — Effect-op result chaining + variable amounts (Spell Damage +X)

**What the old project does:**
Ops (`IOp.Execute(EffectContext)`) take a context, mutate state, return nothing. **No result passed between ops.** Damage amount is hardcoded in the op constructor (`DealDamageOp.cs:10` — `new DealDamageOp(3)`), so Spell Damage +X cannot bump it without rewriting the op. This is a known limitation the old project flagged for "future work."

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Spell Damage +X is in our locked keyword list (§ "Decided feature scope"), so the spec needs to resolve this somewhere. Two questions our spec doesn't answer:
1. **Variable amounts:** how does an effect that says "deal 3 damage" actually become "deal 4 damage" when the caster has Spell Damage +1? The spec mentions in §3 `IKeyword` row that "Spell Damage +X" listens to `SpellCastEvent` and "bumps spell damage amount in context" — but `EffectContext` in §3 `IEffect` doesn't define a `SpellDamage` field. Loose end.
2. **Op chaining:** can a later op reference the *outcome* of an earlier one (e.g. "if any damage was dealt, draw a card"; "summon a copy of the minion you just killed")? Old code can't; some cards in any CCG benchmark require this.

**Recommendation: Adapt.** Two additions to §3:
- **`EffectContext` gains a mutable `SpellDamageBonus: int` and a `Results: List<OpResult>` ledger.** Damage ops read the bonus before applying and append `DamageOpResult { targetId, dealt, killed }` to `Results`. Subsequent ops in the same effect can inspect prior `OpResult`s.
- **Spell-damage application is centralised** in `DealDamageAction`'s handler (not the keyword listener): the handler reads `EffectContext.SpellDamageBonus` if the source action is a spell, adds it to `amount`, then applies. The keyword listener only sets the bonus before the spell resolves. Keeps the math in one place.

**Open questions:**
- Should `Results` be cleared between effects or persist across the entire action's cascade?
- Are there spell-damage interactions we want to *forbid* (Spell Damage on Hero Power damage, e.g.) and where would those filters live?

### ✅ DECISION (2026-05-31): ADAPTED — split in two; leaned down hard from the note's synchronous-op framing

The note's recommendation was written against the old project's **synchronous op model** (ops mutate state inline, could hand results to the next op). **That model is not ours** — our spec (§3 `IActionQueue`) has effects *enqueue* actions; they never mutate state or get a synchronous result back. That single difference splits the item:

**(A) Variable amounts / Spell Damage +X → ADOPTED, via a read-only *pulled* snapshot; Spell Damage demoted from active keyword to declarative.**
- `EffectContext` gains **`SpellDamageBonus: int`**, computed **once at spell-resolution start** and held for the whole cast. Spell-scoped, not hit-scoped (a two-hit spell applies it to both; killing your own Spell-Power minion mid-cascade doesn't drop it for the second half). The shared `DealDamageEffect` bakes it into the enqueued `DealDamageAction`; the handler stays dumb.
- **Spell Damage +X moves out of the Active-keyword (listener) table into the Declarative list.** No `SpellCastEvent` listener, no mutable shared context field, no fire-before-read ordering coupling. The bonus is *pulled* (aggregated on demand), not *pushed*. This is strictly leaner **and** closes the "forbidden interactions" open question for free: the bonus is `0` for non-spell sources, so it structurally cannot leak into combat or hero-power damage.
- **Magnitude lives in the keyword string** (`spell_damage:1`) — no new model field (population is tiny).
- **Aura-granted spell power** reuses the existing `grantedKeywords` rail (an aura grants `spell_damage:X`, rewritten each recalc pass); intrinsic and aura-granted spell power flow through the same aggregation. No new `AuraEffect` channel needed.
- **v1 source list = intrinsic keyword + aura-granted keyword.** That covers the locked "Spell Damage +X" scope.

**(B) Op result chaining / `Results` ledger → REJECTED for v1; redirected to the event bus.**
- "React to an outcome" in our architecture *is* the event bus, hardened by Item 3's epoch filter. "If damage dealt → draw" = an `ITrigger` on `DamageTakenEvent`; "summon a copy of what you killed" reads the death snapshot off `MinionDiedEvent`. A synchronous `Results` ledger is a foreign synchronous-model concept that duplicates the bus. Consistent with **Item 10**, already deferred. Kept on radar only if a card needs same-action *synchronous* inspection the bus genuinely can't express (none expected).

**Player-scoped spell-damage modifiers ("+1 all spells this turn", "+3 next spell") → DEFERRED to the future Modifier System** (`docs/superpowers/notes/2026-05-31-modifier-system.md`). Surfaced during discussion: spell damage and **mana-cost reduction** are the *same shape* (scoped/filtered/lifecycle-bound modifier to a named quantity, aggregated at a read point). The only forward-compatibility constraint mana reduction places on spell damage today is "don't bake a bespoke player-scoped modifier store into spell damage" — honored by simply not building one. The minion-bound + snapshot parts (above) are local to spell resolution, share nothing with cost, and cannot paint us into a corner, so Item 4 resolves now without waiting on the Modifier System. **No reserved `spellPowerModifiers` field** — that would itself be the premature commitment.

Resolved open questions: spell-damage scope = **direct spell damage only** (snapshot at cast; cascade damage attributed to its own source per Item 9); forbidden interactions handled structurally by the `0`-for-non-spell rule. The `Results`-clearing question is moot (rejected).

Spec amended: §3 (Declarative-keywords paragraph — Spell Damage added + pull/aura explanation; Active-keyword table — Spell Damage row removed; `IEffect` — `EffectContext.SpellDamageBonus` defined with snapshot/aggregate/scope rules).

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 08 (keywords)** — Spell Damage implemented as a **declarative** keyword (no listener): a `spell_damage:X` parser + the friendly-board aggregate. Remove any "Spell Damage registers a `SpellCastEvent` listener" framing from the keyword ticket.
- **Epic 08 / aura ticket** — Spell-Power aura grants `spell_damage:X` via `grantedKeywords` on recalc (no new `AuraEffect` field).
- **Spell-resolution / `DefaultCardHandler` ticket** — compute `EffectContext.SpellDamageBonus` once at cast start; `DealDamageEffect` reads it and bakes it into `DealDamageAction`. Add a scenario test: two-hit spell applies bonus to both hits; self-killing-Spell-Power-minion spell keeps bonus for second half; non-spell damage gets `0`.
- **No new ticket for `Results` ledger** (rejected). **No player-scoped-modifier work** here (deferred to Modifier System — see that note for its own plan impact when scheduled).

> **Correction (2026-06-01, via Item 8 follow-on):** aura-granted `spell_damage:X` was specified here to flow into `grantedKeywords`. That was wrong — `grantedKeywords` is the permanent, bounce-retained set, so an aura grant would have survived a `RetainEnchantments` bounce. The keyword model was expanded to a 4-field form (`intrinsic`/`granted`/`aura`/effective `keywords`); aura `spell_damage` now flows into **`auraKeywords`** (recomputed each pass, never retained). Spell Damage remains declarative, so the aura grant is permitted. See Item 8 → "Follow-on amendment".

## Item 5 — `GetLegalActions(playerId)` API surface

**What the old project does:**
**No such API exists.** Bots would need it; the bot folder is stubs. The client UI also benefits from a "which moves can I make right now" query — cards in hand that can't be afforded would be greyed out, targets that aren't legal can't be selected, etc.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Our spec defines a strict pipeline that *rejects* illegal actions, but exposes no positive answer to "what's legal?" Two consumers will want it: bots (Epic for AI isn't on the plan but is on the radar), and the client (Platform API will eventually need it for client-side validation pre-flight). Building it as a first-class engine method is much cheaper than re-implementing the validator outside the engine.

**Recommendation: Adopt.** Add to §3 a new top-level interface (or method on `GameEngine`):
```
IReadOnlyList<GameAction> GetLegalActions(string playerId);
```
Implementation: enumerate every plausible action shape (PlayCard for each card in hand at each viable target; AttackAction for each minion at each legal target; UseHeroPower, EndTurn, etc.) and filter through PhaseGuard + ActionValidator without applying. This makes the action validator the single source of truth for "is this legal," which is exactly the property you want.

**Open questions:**
- This call could be expensive on large boards × full hands × many targets. Do we cache, or accept O(hand × targets) latency? Probably fine for 1v1 CCG sizes.
- Do we expose this in `CCG.GameLogic` or only at the Game Server layer? Recommend: in the library.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-05-31): ADOPTED — seam now, enumerator deferred to a future bot-support epic

Split the item the way Item 4's player-scoped modifiers were split: lock the cheap architectural seam in the spec now; defer the speculative machinery to where its consumer lives.

- **Lock now (spec, v1): validation (②③) is a pure, side-effect-free, standalone-invokable predicate** `(action, state) → Ok | Rejection` — no mutation/dispatch/events — and the **single source of truth for legality**. `Submit` calls it before ④; any "is this legal / what's legal" query must call the *same* predicate, so enumerated legality can never drift from what `Submit` accepts. (Our pipeline already separates ②③ from ④, so this is mostly making it explicit + a named unit.) Spec amended: §4 ③.
- **`GetLegalActions(playerId)` itself → DEFERRED to a new future bot-support epic** (see Plan impact). No consumer in core v1 scope (bots are a deferred subsystem; client pre-flight is a Game-Server/client concern; tests can hit the predicate directly). Building the enumerator now would be YAGNI — **but the user has confirmed bots are definitely coming**, so it is *deferred, not rejected*, and gets a home.
- **Home = `CCG.GameLogic`** (confirmed, not the Game Server). The library must be complete without depending on the server; the validator lives in the library, so the enumerator that reuses it does too — and tests, bots, and the Unity client (which references the library directly) all consume it. Pure enumeration + validation, no framework deps, so it doesn't violate the "no engine/framework deps" rule.
- **Approach = brute-force-then-filter** (locked): generate candidate actions (`PlayCard` per hand card × every entity; `Attack` per minion × every entity; `HeroPower`; `EndTurn`; …) and let the standalone predicate reject the illegal ones. Reuses the validator exactly, handles edge cases for free (a must-target spell on an empty board yields zero legal pairs → correctly unplayable), and **decouples this from Item 12** (no target *enumerator* needed — only the existing target *validator*). O(hand × entities) is fine at 1v1 sizes; no caching (YAGNI).
- **Phase-aware:** runs Phase Guard first, so in `PendingChoice`/`PendingIntervention` it surfaces the already-enumerated options from the pending-state object; meaningful primarily in `InProgress`. **Do not enumerate Mulligan keep-subsets** (2^handsize) — leave that to `MulliganState`.

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 01 / validator ticket** (Phase Guard + Action Validator) — expose ②③ as a **pure, standalone-invokable predicate** `(action, state) → Ok | Rejection`, callable independently of `Submit`/dispatch. `Submit` consumes it. This is the only v1 change. (Pairs naturally with **Item 7** structured rejections when that's decided — the predicate returns the rejection code.)
- **NEW EPIC (end of plan): Bot Support.** Created during reconciliation to house `GetLegalActions(playerId)` (brute-force-then-filter, library-resident, phase-aware) **plus the other logic a bot needs** (move generation/scoring scaffolding, state evaluation hooks, a bot driver loop, etc. — to be fleshed out when the epic is written). `GetLegalActions` is its first ticket. Depends only on the ②③ predicate seam above. Add to the README epic index during reconciliation.

## Item 6 — Deterministic `IRandom` interface with seeded RNG

**What the old project does:**
**No RNG infrastructure.** No `IRandom`, no seeded calls, no random discards or random targets. Effects are deterministic only because none of them involve randomness yet.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Several actions on our list are inherently random: `DiscardCardAction { cardId? — null = random }` (§2A), discover (Epic 12), and any future "random enemy minion" target. Our spec doesn't define where the randomness comes from, and that's a determinism hole. Without a seeded `IRandom`, replay is impossible — and the spec already references replay as a future capability ("Event-log replay" in Epic 16 backlog).

**Recommendation: Adopt.** Add to §3:
```
IRandom { int Next(int maxExclusive); int Next(int minInclusive, int maxExclusive); }
```
`GameState.rngSeed: ulong` is set at game creation and threaded through `IRandom`. Every random pick uses `IRandom` — no `Random.Shared` anywhere. Document in spec: *"Replay determinism requires that every random call go through `IRandom`. Implementations must be reproducible given seed."*

Tests can pass a deterministic seed for repeatable scenarios.

**Open questions:**
- Should the seed be public (so clients can verify replay) or hidden (so opponents can't predict)? Probably hidden, but tests need access.
- One RNG per game or per player? One per game is simpler; per player avoids correlated rolls.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-06-01): ADOPTED — counter-based per-action reseed; shuffle at init from seed

The `IRandom` interface is adopted as recommended. The substance was in *how* reproducibility works, and we landed on the **counter-based / splittable-RNG** model rather than a single advancing stream.

- **Interface (spec §3 `IRandom`):** `int Next(int maxExclusive)` + `int Next(int minInclusive, int maxExclusive)`. Every random pick goes through an injected `IRandom`; no `Random.Shared`/clock-seeded/ambient RNG anywhere. Stated as the determinism contract.
- **Seed (spec, `GameState.rngSeed: ulong`):** fixed at match creation, never mutates. Both *open questions resolved by architecture, not preference*: **visibility** — the client is a pure event renderer and never receives `GameState`, so the seed is structurally hidden (can't be used to predict draws); tests inject a chosen seed. This is exactly the PvP-CCG industry pattern (Hearthstone/MTGA keep the seed server-side and ship event logs; the seed *is* hidden information). **One-RNG-per-game vs per-player** — moot under the counter-based model: there is one logical source per match, split per action by epoch; per-player streams add nothing in 1v1. YAGNI.
- **Per-action reseed by epoch (the real decision):** **no single long-lived PRNG.** At the start of each action's stage ④ the engine derives a fresh `IRandom` from `mix(rngSeed, currentActionEpoch)` (strong mixer, e.g. splitmix64). Picked over a single advancing stream because the already-locked `StabilizationAbortReport` hands you a *mid-game* `preActionState` and must reproduce a single action in isolation — a continuous stream would force serializing PRNG internal state into every snapshot; counter-based makes any action reproducible from `(rngSeed, epoch, preActionState)` with **zero PRNG-state serialization**. This is the JAX-key-split / NumPy `SeedSequence.spawn` / Slay-the-Spire-per-domain-stream model, and it **reuses the `currentActionEpoch` already introduced for Item 3's event-visibility filter** — one counter, two jobs.
- **`currentActionEpoch` moved into `GameState`** (minor refinement to Item 3, which originally placed it on `GameEngine`). Rationale: making RNG a pure function of state (`mix(state.rngSeed, state.currentActionEpoch)`) makes snapshots self-describing — `StabilizationAbortReport.preActionState` now carries the epoch, so the report needs **no new field** to be reproducible. Matches the user's articulated mental model exactly ("every action carries the gamestate, the epoch, and the seed").
- **Where randomness is consumed:** only in stage ④ handlers (the sole mutation point). Effects/triggers needing a random outcome enqueue an action whose handler rolls (`DiscardCardAction{cardId=null}`, Discover option generation, random-target actions). Selector RNG access (Item 12's open question) **deferred to Item 12**.
- **Deck shuffle → at init, from the seed (Fork B decided by user):** engine runs a Fisher-Yates over `IRandom` at match setup; **decklists are the stored input, shuffled order regenerates from `rngSeed`.** Coin flip + opening deal seeded the same way.
- **Replay model (clarified, ties into Item 13):** a full game = `rngSeed` + both **decklists** + the ordered log of **player actions** only. System actions, random rolls, and the whole event cascade regenerate; `currentActionEpoch` reconstructs by counting actions (not stored in the log). Mid-game slice repro (abort report) relies on the epoch carried in the captured `GameState`.

Spec amended: §1 `GameState` (+`rngSeed`, +`currentActionEpoch`), §3 new `IRandom` subsection + Deterministic Ordering table row, §4 ④ (per-action RNG derivation), §4 ⑦ `StabilizationAbortReport` comment (epoch-carried-in-state reproducibility).

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 01 — NEW foundation ticket (suggest T1.9): `IRandom` + `DeterministicRandom`.** `IRandom` interface, a splittable/counter-based impl, the `mix(seed, epoch)` derivation helper, and a `Shuffle` (Fisher-Yates) extension over `IRandom`. Unit tests: same `(seed, epoch)` ⇒ identical sequence; adjacent epochs uncorrelated; `Shuffle` reproducible.
- **Epic 01 T1.x (`GameState`)** — add `rngSeed: ulong` and `currentActionEpoch: int` to the state record.
- **Epic 01 T1.8 (`GameEngine` pipeline)** — at stage ④, derive the per-action `IRandom` from `mix(rngSeed, currentActionEpoch)` (the epoch increment already lands here from Item 3); thread it to the dispatched handler.
- **Epic 04 T4.8 (`StabilizationAbortReport`)** — confirm `preActionState` carries `currentActionEpoch` so the report is self-contained (no separate epoch field). Dependency on this ticket (flagged in Item 1) is now satisfied.
- **Game-setup ticket (shuffle/coin/opening deal)** — perform the shuffle via the `Shuffle` extension over the per-action `IRandom`; store decklists, not shuffled order.
- **Epic 16 / replay backlog (Item 13)** — record the replay package as `rngSeed` + decklists + player-action log; do not log system actions or epochs.

## Item 7 — Structured error codes alongside string messages

**What the old project does:**
`Result.Fail("Card is not in hand.")` (PlayCardResolver.cs throughout). Tests assert exact string equality. Works, but hardcodes UI copy in the engine and ties tests to wording.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
The Game Server will return rejection reasons to the client. The client wants to localise / format these. Tests want stable identifiers, not English strings. Internationalization aside, the engine should be a structured-error producer, not a UI string source.

**Recommendation: Adopt with adaptation.** §2 or §3 introduces:
```
enum ActionRejectionCode {
    NotYourTurn, NotInHand, NotEnoughMana, BoardFull,
    InvalidTarget, TauntMustBeTargeted, AttackerCannotAttack,
    PhaseDoesNotAllowAction, /* … */
}
record ActionRejection(ActionRejectionCode Code, string Detail);
```
Engine returns rejections; UI layer maps codes to localised strings; tests assert on `Code`. `Detail` carries optional diagnostic context (e.g. "needs 5, has 3 mana") for logs.

**Open questions:**
- Do we want a rejection event published on the bus, or just a return value from `Submit`? Recommend return value only — rejected actions never enter the event log.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-06-01): ADOPTED — code + optional non-contractual Detail; return value only

Structural work was already done by **Item 5** (validation = pure predicate `(action, state) → Ok | Rejection`); Item 7 just gives `Rejection` its shape. Adopted as recommended, leaned to the middle on the payload question.

- **`ActionRejectionCode` enum (closed)** — the legality vocabulary; stable identifiers tests assert on, codes the Game Server maps to localized client strings. Members derive directly from the §4 ②③ rules (`WrongPhase`, `NotActivePlayer`, `CardNotInHand`, `NotEnoughMana`, `InvalidTarget`, `TargetStealthed`, `MustTargetTaunt`, `AttackerCannotAttack`, `AttackerFrozen`, `AttackerExhausted`, `BoardFull`, …). Grows in lockstep with validation rules; single producer (the Item 5 predicate).
- **`record ActionRejection(ActionRejectionCode Code, string? Detail = null)`** — chose **code + optional Detail** over code-only and over structured payload. `Code` is the contract; **`Detail` is free-form, logs-only, explicitly non-contractual** (never asserted in tests, never shown to users, may be null). **Typed per-code payloads rejected as premature** (the deciding reasoning, recorded in discussion): the payload data is reconstructable by the caller from `(action, state)`; no current consumer (tests assert on `Code`; client localizes from `Code`; logs have `action`+`state`) is blocked without it; it would add a per-code type + wire encoding + client branch per rule against an open rule set; and the lean options keep a clean upgrade path (promote *one* code to a payload later if one is ever found that genuinely can't be reconstructed). Detail is the pragmatic middle — a cheap diagnostic without committing to a schema.
- **Delivery = return value only** (resolves the open question). Rejection is the negative arm of `Submit`'s result; **never a `GameEvent`, never on the bus, never in the event log.** Consistent with Item 5 (validation side-effect-free) and Item 6 (only real state-changing player actions are logged; rejected actions re-reject on replay). The Game Server relays the `Rejected` result to the originating client as that request's response. No `ActionRejectedEvent`.
- **`Submit` return type promoted** to a discriminated `SubmitResult = Accepted(IReadOnlyList<GameEvent>) | Rejected(ActionRejection)` (was "returns the full event list"). Falls out of the above; not a separate decision.

Spec amended: new **§2C Action Rejection** (enum + `ActionRejection` + `SubmitResult`), §4 ① (Submit returns `SubmitResult`), §4 ② (`Rejected(WrongPhase)`), §4 ③ (each precondition annotated with its code; returns `Rejected`), §4 ③ predicate paragraph (cross-ref to §2C). Also fixed the §3 lead-in that hard-counted "six interfaces" (stale since Item 2's `ITriggerCondition` and Item 6's `IRandom`) to a non-brittle extensibility/infrastructure listing.

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 01 / validator ticket** (Phase Guard + Action Validator, the Item 5 predicate) — define `ActionRejectionCode` + `ActionRejection`; the predicate returns `Ok | Rejection`. This is the single producer of codes. Unit tests assert on `Code`, not strings.
- **Epic 01 T1.8 (`GameEngine` / `Submit`)** — change the return contract to `SubmitResult` (`Accepted` | `Rejected`); ②③ failures short-circuit to `Rejected` before ④.
- **All Epic 01–16 validation tests** — assert on `Code` rather than English strings (the old-project pattern this item replaces). Establish the `Code`-assertion convention in the first validator ticket so later epics follow it.
- **Game Server (out of `CCG.GameLogic`, future)** — owns code→localized-string mapping and relaying `Rejected` over WebSocket; library stays UI-string-free.

## Item 8 — Card definition hooks for art / description / sound / tribe

**What the old project does:**
`CardDefinition` carries `CardId`, `Name`, `Type`, `ManaCost`, base stats, and behaviour hooks (PlayAction, Triggers, OnDeathEffects). **No art key, description text, sound cues, tribe/race ("Beast", "Demon"), or rarity.** The Unity SO layer adds none of these either.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
We have `rarity` on `Card`. We don't have anything else presentation-layer or gameplay-tag related. The library is supposed to be standalone — it shouldn't reference art assets — but it does need to carry an opaque art key string for the client to resolve. Same for description text (for tooltip rendering) and tribe (which is gameplay-relevant — "all Beasts get +1/+1").

**Recommendation: Adopt selectively.** Extend `Card` definition with:
- `artKey: string` — opaque identifier the client resolves
- `description: string` — pre-templated for localisation later
- `tribes: string[]` — gameplay-relevant tags ("Beast", "Demon", …); empty for non-tribal
- `sfxKey?: string` — optional, opaque

Leave the actual asset resolution entirely to the client; the library treats these as opaque strings. Tribes might want a typed enum if the set is small and locked, but `string[]` is more flexible.

**Open questions:**
- Tribes: typed enum (locked set) or open strings (any tag)? Hearthstone has ~10 tribes; we could lock them. But open strings let card-crafting (T16.6) invent new ones, which is a feature.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-06-01): ADOPTED SELECTIVELY — tribes in as a `[Flags]` enum; presentation out of the library

Split on one line: **does game logic read it, or only the client?** Tribes are read by logic → first-class typed; art/description/sfx are client-only → not in the library at all (leaner than the note's "carry an opaque artKey").

- **Tribes → `[Flags] enum Tribe`** (resolves the open question; user initially leaned enum, and on analysis the enum is the better fit — the recommendation was *revised* away from the string[] lean). The deciding insight: **keywords are strings because each resolves to an `IKeyword` *implementation*; a tribe resolves to nothing — it's an inert label, all behavior lives in the cards that reference it.** So the string-keyed-extension-point rationale doesn't transfer; tribes are a closed designer-curated taxonomy, the textbook enum case. `[Flags]` specifically because the requirement is **multi-tribe + grantable**: membership = `(tribes & Tribe.Beast) != 0`, granting = `|=`, removal = `& ~` — allocation-free, cheap in hot aura-recalc, multi-value native. The only cost (closed set → recompile to add a tribe) is a non-issue: new tribes ship with the content release that adds their cards, which is a library version bump regardless. String[] would only win for hot-adding tribes to a *running, un-redeployed* engine — not our deployment model.
- **Tribeless allowed** (user refinement, supersedes an earlier "≥1 tribe" thought): `Tribe.None = 0` is a valid state and participates correctly in all bitwise ops, so tribeless cards/minions need zero special-casing. No load-time non-empty validation.
- **Tribe-granting model** (user asked to design it): three separate fields on `MinionOnBoard`, mirroring the keyword model but kept apart so aura contributions never pollute persistent state (same discipline as `auraAttackBonus`):
  - `intrinsicTribes` — from definition, copied at summon, immutable, **survives Silence** (silenced Beast is still a Beast).
  - `grantedTribes` — permanent grants ("becomes a Beast"), **Silence clears to `Tribe.None`**.
  - `auraTribes` — from active `IAura`, recomputed each pass, never persisted, drops with the aura.
  - `effectiveTribes = intrinsicTribes | grantedTribes | auraTribes` — what the engine queries. `Card` exposes only intrinsic `tribes: Tribe`; the three-way split is minion-only. All three included now (permanent + aura granting) since `[Flags]` makes the extra field free — no YAGNI deferral needed.
- **Presentation (art / description / sfx) → OUT of `CCG.GameLogic`.** Client resolves from the Platform-API presentation catalog by `definitionKey` (which it already has on every rendered entity), exactly as it resolves art. Preserves the library's "no presentation deps" property; consistent with the borrow list's own "animation/presentation belongs to the client" omission. `rarity` stays on `Card` (plausibly gameplay-relevant — Discover-a-Legendary).

Spec amended: §1 `Card` (+`tribes: Tribe`), §1 `MinionOnBoard` (+`intrinsicTribes`/`grantedTribes`/`auraTribes`/`effectiveTribes`), new §1 **Tribes** subsection (the `[Flags] enum Tribe` + sources + Silence rule) and **Presentation data (out of library scope)** subsection, §3 `IAura` (`AuraEffect.GrantedTribes` + recompute rule).

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 01 / data-model tickets** — add the `[Flags] enum Tribe`; add `tribes: Tribe` to `Card`; add the four tribe fields to `MinionOnBoard`; `effectiveTribes` as a computed property.
- **Epic 04 (summon) ticket** — initialize `intrinsicTribes` from `card.tribes` at summon; `grantedTribes`/`auraTribes` start `Tribe.None`.
- **Epic 08 / Silence ticket** — Silence clears `grantedTribes` (→ `None`), leaves `intrinsicTribes`. Add to the existing "Silence clears enchantments/grantedKeywords" behavior.
- **Aura ticket (`IAura`/recalc)** — `AuraEffect` gains `GrantedTribes`; recalc rewrites each target's `auraTribes` as the OR of incoming grants (alongside the attack/health bonus rewrite). Add a scenario test: tribal aura grants `Beast`, drops when the aura source leaves; Silence does not remove the *intrinsic* tribe.
- **No library work for art/description/sfx** — Platform-API catalog + client concern; out of scope here.

#### Follow-on amendment (2026-06-01): keywords expanded to the same 4-field model

Prompted by a user consistency question (tribes got 4 fields — `intrinsic`/`granted`/`aura`/`effective` — why do keywords have only 2?). On inspection the asymmetry hid a **real bug from Item 4**: that decision routed aura-granted `spell_damage:X` into `grantedKeywords`, but `grantedKeywords` is the **permanent, RetainEnchantments-bounce-retained** set — so an aura grant would wrongly survive a bounce, and it contradicted `grantedKeywords`'s own "non-aura" definition.

- **`MinionOnBoard` keywords now mirror tribes:** `intrinsicKeywords` (from def, seeded at summon, Silence clears) + `grantedKeywords` (permanent non-aura grants, bounce-retained, Silence clears, **aura grants NOT here**) + `auraKeywords` (aura-granted, recomputed each pass, never persisted/retained) → `keywords` (maintained effective union, IKeyword-resolved, what the engine queries).
- **Silence asymmetry vs tribes (deliberate, documented):** keywords — Silence clears `intrinsic` **and** `granted` (a silenced Taunt minion loses Taunt); tribes — Silence clears `granted` only (silenced Beast is still a Beast). `auraKeywords`/`auraTribes` untouched by Silence (they recompute).
- **`AuraEffect` gained `GrantedKeywords` (declarative-only)** alongside `GrantedTribes`; recalc rewrites `auraKeywords` from it.
- **Scope lever = declarative-only aura keywords.** Active keywords (listener-backed: Lifesteal/Poisonous/Enrage/Windfury/Freeze) cannot be aura-granted, because subscribing during recalc (⑥) would violate **Item 3's invariant** ("all subscriptions inside action handlers ④"). Declarative aura grants (Taunt, `spell_damage`, …) need no listener, so recalc stays a side-effect-free list rewrite. Active keywords still work via `intrinsic`/`granted` (their OnApplied/OnRemoved fire in ④ handlers). Aura-granted *active* keywords → **Unaddressed Features** (see below).
- **Item 4 correction applied:** aura `spell_damage:X` now flows into `auraKeywords`, not `grantedKeywords`. (Marked at Item 4's decision block.)

**New convention — "Unaddressed Features" registry:** added a top-level section to the spec for features the architecture deliberately does not support and that are deferred **indefinitely** (distinct from "deferred to a future epic" items like `GetLegalActions` or the Modifier System, which have a planned home). First entry: **aura-granted active keywords** (why: Item 3 subscription-timing invariant; cost to enable: deferred-subscription mechanism + reopening Item 3). Use this section for future indefinite deferrals.

**Plan impact (additions to Item 8's list):**
- **Epic 01 / `MinionOnBoard` ticket** — add `intrinsicKeywords` + `auraKeywords`; `keywords` becomes the maintained effective union; restate `grantedKeywords` as permanent/bounce-retained only.
- **Epic 08 / Silence ticket** — clear `intrinsicKeywords` + `grantedKeywords`; leave `auraKeywords`.
- **Epic 08 / bounce (T16.3) ticket** — retain `grantedKeywords` only; `auraKeywords` vanish on transition (already noted in §1 transition table).
- **Aura ticket** — `AuraEffect.GrantedKeywords` (declarative-only); recalc rewrites `auraKeywords`; assert active keywords are rejected/ignored from aura grants.
- **Epic 08 / Spell Damage** — aura path targets `auraKeywords` (Item 4 correction).

## Item 9 — `PlayContext → EffectContext` conversion / nested contexts

**What the old project does:**
`PlayContext` is the higher-level context held by `PlayCardResolver` (caster, target, services). When an effect needs to fire, `PlayContext.ToEffectContext()` (PlayContext.cs:44–45) produces a lighter `EffectContext` for the op chain. Clean separation: high-level resolvers don't pollute low-level ops with all their fields.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Our spec defines `EffectContext` in §3 (`sourceCardId, sourcePlayerId, targetId?, read-only GameState`). It doesn't define how this is constructed inside an action handler, or how nested effects inherit context. A trigger that fires during another effect's cascade — what's its `EffectContext.sourcePlayerId`? The original caster, the trigger source's owner, or the active player? Not specified.

**Recommendation: Adopt as a clarification.** Add to §3 a paragraph: *"Each action handler constructs an `EffectContext` from its action's fields. Triggers fired during an action's event cascade construct their own `EffectContext` from the trigger source minion (not the original action's caster). Nested effects fired by triggers always identify themselves as the trigger source, not the originating action."* This determines who gets credited (e.g., for stats), who gets the spell-damage bonus, and so on.

**Open questions:**
- This decision affects "if Yeti's deathrattle damages a minion, who is the *source* of that damage — Yeti, or the spell that killed Yeti?" Real gameplay implications (poisonous, lifesteal attribution). Recommend: Yeti.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-06-01): ADOPTED as a clarification — attribution rule locked; two latent gaps fixed

The attribution *plumbing* already existed (every action + the key events carry `sourceId`; Item 2's conditions key off the trigger host's `sourceId`). So this item is the **rule** + two fixes it surfaced. Four decisions:

1. **Source attribution rule:** `sourceId` is the entity *whose effect this is*, set by **whoever enqueues the action**, and **never inherited from the upstream cause**. A trigger's `OnFire` stamps `sourceId = its host entity`. Played card → the card; minion's triggered effect → that minion; hero power/weapon → itself. `sourcePlayerId` = the source's controller, captured at enqueue (from death snapshot if already dead). **Yeti's deathrattle damage is sourced to Yeti**, not the spell that killed it (resolves the open question). No "original caster" inheritance.
2. **Generalize `EffectContext.sourceCardId` → `sourceId`** (unified entity ref, the one every action/event already uses) + keep `sourcePlayerId`. The old `sourceCardId` couldn't express a minion-sourced effect (a deathrattle has no card). Relies only on the session-unique-id assumption `targetId` already makes.
3. **Fix the Lifesteal listener wording:** it read "`DamageTakenEvent` on self" (= *taking* damage — backwards); corrected to **caused by self** (`evt.sourceId == this minion`), mirroring Poisonous. Attribution is the field both filter on.
4. **Accept dead-source active keywords don't fire:** a dead minion's deathrattle damage is still *attributed* to it (watchers/friend-enemy resolve correctly), but its Lifesteal/Poisonous don't trigger — those are listener-backed and the listeners were unsubscribed at Phase 1, before the deathrattle resolves in Phase 2. **Key distinction recorded: attribution (data on the event) ≠ keyword application (live listeners).** Falls out of the active-keyword model with no special-casing; logged to **Unaddressed Features** (snapshot-based application is the deferred path).

Spell-damage stays consistent for free: a spell's `DealDamageAction` has `sourceId` = the spell card (cast-time bonus applies); non-spell source → `0` (Item 4, already structural).

Spec amended: §3 `IEffect` (`EffectContext.sourceId` + new **Source Attribution** subsection), §3 Active-keyword table (Lifesteal corrected), **Unaddressed Features** (new entry: active keywords on a dead source).

**Plan impact:**
- **Epic 01 / `EffectContext` ticket** — field is `sourceId` (not `sourceCardId`); `EffectContext` built from the action's own source fields.
- **Action-enqueue sites (Epics 08 triggers, effects)** — every enqueuer stamps `sourceId` = its host/source entity; trigger `OnFire` uses the host, never the upstream action's source. Add a scenario test: spell kills Yeti → Yeti's deathrattle `DealDamageAction.sourceId == Yeti`; a "when a friendly minion deals damage" watcher credits Yeti.
- **Epic 08 / Lifesteal ticket** — listener filters on `evt.sourceId == self` (caused-by-self), not self-as-target. Add a test: Lifesteal minion attacking heals owner; the minion *taking* damage does not.
- **Epic 08 / Lifesteal+Poisonous + death** — test that a dead minion's deathrattle damage does NOT lifesteal/poison (listeners gone), but the event's `sourceId` still names it.

## Item 10 — `IEffect` op `Results` ledger as a debugging / tooling target

**What the old project does:**
Not present. Effects fire and forget.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
If §3 `IEffect.Execute` writes nothing observable beyond events, a "why did this card not fire its second effect" debug session is a search through the event log. A small ledger — one entry per op invocation with `{opType, succeeded, summary}` — would massively shorten that loop. Same ledger feeds tooling (replay viewer, card-design preview).

**Recommendation: Keep on radar; defer.** Don't bake it into the v1 spec; the event log is sufficient for v1 cards. Revisit when we hit a card whose debugging would have benefited.

**Open questions:** none for now.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-06-01): REJECTED for v1 — both halves; the need is served by existing mechanisms, nothing is withheld

(The recommendation's "defer / keep on radar" was incoherent on review — "deferred" and "rejected" can't both hold, and nothing is actually being withheld. Resolved cleanly as a reject. This also sharpens Item 4's loose "consistent with Item 10, already deferred" reference: read it as *rejected*.)

- **(a) Gameplay op-result chaining** — rejected in Item 4, redirected to the event bus (`DamageTakenEvent` + an `ITrigger`). Need fully met.
- **(b) Observability/tooling ledger** — also rejected. Debugging "why didn't the second effect fire?" is served by deterministically *replaying* the action with verbose tracing (Item 6 makes any action re-runnable; `StabilizationAbortReport` carries the repro inputs); a replay-viewer/card-preview tool would consume the event log, not a per-op ledger. No capability withheld.
- **Why reject, not Unaddressed Feature:** that registry is for architectural can't-dos held open with a cost-to-enable (e.g. aura-granted active keywords vs the Item 3 invariant). This is the opposite — trivially *additive* anytime (`IEffect.Execute` stays `void`; just a cross-cutting tracer the engine could wrap around effect execution) and not *needed*. No blocker, no withheld capability → registering it would be noise. Built as ordinary additive tooling if a concrete need ever appears that replay can't serve.

**Disposition test applied going forward:** need met by an existing mechanism / additive anytime → **reject** (decision note only); architecture can't do it without reopening a locked decision → **Unaddressed Features** (cost-to-enable + revisit trigger); real capability, no home yet but planned → **future-epic deferral**. Item 10 is the first.

Spec amended: none. **Plan impact:** none.

---

## Item 11 — Game engine builder pattern

**What the old project does:**
`GameBootstrapper` (GameBootstrapper.cs:32–70) wires up everything manually inside one MonoBehaviour. Order matters; services are constructed inside `GameEngine` constructor. Works fine for one-shot setup.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
For tests, the scenario builder will need to construct an engine in many slightly different configurations (different starting mana, different RNG seeds, mocked aura services, custom card libraries). A small builder makes this readable.

**Recommendation: Keep on radar; let the test framework drive it.** Don't put a builder in the spec — that's an implementation detail. The scenario builder helpers from §11 of our plan (T1.7) will produce one organically.

**Open questions:** none.

### ✅ DECISION (2026-06-01): NOT A SPEC CONCERN — implementation detail; home = the plan's scenario builder (T1.7)

- A builder/bootstrap is construction convenience, not a behavioral contract. By the Item 10 disposition test it's the "additive / met elsewhere" bucket → stays out of the spec. Recommendation adopted as-is; no open questions.
- **Two construction paths, neither a spec concern:** *Production* — engine init seeds `rngSeed`, then runs setup as system actions (shuffle via Fisher-Yates over `IRandom`, coin flip, opening deal — §3 `IRandom` / Item 6); wiring/DI is a Game Server concern. *Tests* — the T1.7 scenario builder constructs arbitrary `GameState` directly for the Build step, bypassing init to reach specific mid-game states.

Spec amended: none.

**Plan impact:** T1.7's scenario builder grew over this pass — it must now set/handle `rngSeed` + `currentActionEpoch` (Items 6/3) and deterministic seed injection, optional deck-setup vs direct board construction, and the new per-minion fields: `intrinsicTribes`/`grantedTribes`/`auraTribes` (Item 8) and the 4-field keywords `intrinsicKeywords`/`grantedKeywords`/`auraKeywords` (Item 8 follow-on). Flag these in T1.7 so the builder exposes them ergonomically.

---

## Item 12 — Targeting strategy registry vs. switch

**What the old project does:**
`EffectResolver.Resolve` (EffectResolver.cs:7–21) switches on `TargetingRule` enum to call hardcoded `TargetingService` methods. Adding a new targeting rule requires editing both the enum and the resolver.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
Our spec doesn't say how targeting is structured. The locked feature list includes mid-effect targeting (an interactive pause), `Discover`, and likely random/multi-target effects. The old project's enum-switch will not scale — every new rule edits the central switch and the central service. A `Dictionary<TargetingRule, ITargetSelector>` (or `Func<EffectContext, EntityId[]>`) would let each rule live in its own file.

**Recommendation: Adapt.** Add to §3 an `ITargetSelector` interface:
```
interface ITargetSelector {
    string SelectorId { get; }
    TargetSelection Select(EffectContext context); // returns 0..N targets, or "needs choice"
}
```
`TargetSelection` can be `Immediate(EntityId[])` or `RequiresChoice(StartChoiceAction)`. The choice path threads into the existing `PendingChoice` mechanism.

**Open questions:**
- Selectors that need RNG access — do they receive `IRandom` via `EffectContext`?
- Should multi-target selectors return an ordered or unordered list?

---

## Item 13 — Command-log replay vs. event-log replay

**What the old project does:**
Neither is implemented (both `GameSnapshot.cs` and `EventLog.cs` are stubs). The investigation flagged this as "design fresh." Worth choosing the strategy in the spec.

**Why it might matter for our spec:**
The plan's Epic 16 backlog mentions "Event-log replay — reconstruct GameState from the event stream." That's only sound if every state change has a corresponding event (currently true). The alternative — replaying the command/action log — is also sound *if* the engine is deterministic (which requires Item 6 above to be done).

**Recommendation: Keep on radar; decide before implementing Epic 16 backlog item.** Pre-decision: **command-log replay is simpler and faster** because the event log can be regenerated from the command log + seed; the reverse is not true (events don't encode random rolls). Probably we want both: command-log for canonical replay, event-log as the wire format to clients.

**Open questions:**
- Single sequence per game, or per-player streams? Single is simpler.

---

## Topics deliberately omitted

These came up in the investigation but don't merit changes:

- **Uniform ID model (single counter for cards and minions).** Old project does this; our spec deliberately splits them. The split was justified by the Card-vs-Minion type distinction and survives every scenario we walked through (tokens, copies, transforms, resurrection, return-to-hand with policies). No change.
- **Animation playback layer.** Belongs to the client (Unity/Godot), not `CCG.GameLogic`. Out of scope.
- **Multiplayer scaffolding.** Belongs to the Game Server (C# / ASP.NET Core), not `CCG.GameLogic`. Out of scope.
- **AI / Bot scaffolding.** Whole subsystem — defer to a future epic after the core lands. Item 5 (`GetLegalActions`) is the only piece the library needs to expose for bots to be possible.

## How to use this file

Pick one item at a time. For each: confirm whether it goes into the spec, into the plan, or gets rejected. When a decision is made, this file gets updated with the decision and the spec is amended in the same session.

**Spec-first workflow + Plan-impact convention (set 2026-05-31).** During the borrow-list pass we amend the **spec only**, not the epic/ticket files — those are reconciled in one pass at the end (see below). To keep that reconciliation mechanical rather than archaeological, every `✅ DECISION` block ends with a **Plan impact:** list naming the affected epics/tickets and the change each needs, and flagging where a **NEW ticket** (or epic) is likely required. Carry this convention forward for every remaining item.

## Plan reconciliation — end-of-pass task

After all 13 items are walked through, before implementation begins at Epic 01 / T1.1:

1. Walk every `Plan impact:` list in this file and apply the edits to the corresponding epic/ticket files under `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-27-ccg-game-logic/`.
2. **Create new tickets / epics where flagged.** The amendments have already surfaced needs the original plan didn't cover — known so far:
   - `StabilizationAbortReport` telemetry (Item 1 → new Epic 04 **T4.8**).
   - `ITriggerCondition` library as its own unit (Item 2 → new Epic 08 **T8.10**).
   - **NEW EPIC: Bot Support** (Item 5 → end of plan) — houses `GetLegalActions(playerId)` (brute-force-then-filter, library-resident, phase-aware; first ticket) **plus other bot-building logic** (move generation/scoring, state evaluation, bot driver loop — flesh out when writing the epic). Depends only on the Item 5 ②③-predicate seam (Epic 01 validator ticket).
   Remaining items may add more (e.g. Item 6 `IRandom` likely wants a foundation ticket; Item 7 structured error codes, Item 12 targeting registry may each need their own). Do not force everything into existing tickets — add tickets/epics freely so each finalized amendment has a home, and update the README index + ticket outline + writing-progress tracker to match.
3. Re-verify the README's "Resume point" line and epic index reflect the reconciled plan.
