## Section 1: Data Model

### GameState

```
sessionId: string
player1: PlayerState
player2: PlayerState
neutralZone: MinionOnBoard[]          // ownerId = null. The neutral lane is a THIRD side (its own ownerId bucket), modeled as close to a player lane as possible so board-wide mechanics — triggers, auras, summon events — work out of the box. Taunt is per-LANE (a neutral Taunt forces attacks aimed INTO the neutral lane, but not into the opponent lane — and vice versa; §4 ③). Friendly/enemy is LANE-based (§3 `ITriggerCondition`): a player's friendly-scoped aura/trigger excludes the neutral lane, but a neutral minion's OWN friendly scope IS the neutral lane (so neutral minions buff/trigger off each other). Reaching the lane from a player effect needs an explicit `AllNeutralMinions`/`AllMinions` selector.
neutralZoneConfig: NeutralZoneConfig? // null = no neutral zone in this game mode
neutralGraveyard: GraveyardEntry[]    // single shared graveyard, owned by GameState (NOT per-player). A dead minion lands here iff bornNeutral && ownerId == null at death (system-spawned neutral that died in the neutral lane); see §4 ⑦ Phase 1 routing
turn: TurnState
timer: TimerState
phase: GamePhase                      // Mulligan | WaitingForPlayers | InProgress | PendingChoice | PendingIntervention | Ended
winnerId?: string
pendingChoice?: PendingChoice
pendingIntervention?: PendingIntervention
mulliganState?: MulliganState
rngSeed: ulong                        // fixed at match creation; drives ALL randomness via IRandom; server-side, never sent to client
currentActionEpoch: int               // monotonic; ++ per action at stage ④; used for event-visibility filter AND per-action RNG derivation (see §3 IEventBus, IRandom)
```

### NeutralZoneConfig

```
maxCapacity: int
spawnPool: Card[]
firstSpawnTurn: int      // = GameConstants.NeutralFirstSpawnTurn (3): the first turn whose Interturn handover (Turn Lifecycle step 5) repopulates the lane. Before it the lane stays EMPTY; from it on, EVERY handover tops the lane up to maxCapacity (initial seed and recurring refill are one rule). Replaces the old repopulateOnTurnStart bool — neutral spawn timing is now fixed to the neutral handover (turn-END), NOT turn-start, so the upcoming player always gets first crack at what was added (§4 Turn Lifecycle step 5).
```

### GameConstants

Engine-wide constants — the **single source** for setup values and caps, so a future game mode (or a deck-conditional rule, e.g. "deck contains card X ⇒ that player's mana cap +1") overrides them in one place rather than at scattered call sites. Values are the v1 defaults (HS-faithful where an analogue exists). `MaxArtifacts`/`MaxInscriptions`/`MaxDeathWaves` were already referenced inline elsewhere — this block is now their definition too (closing the scattered-magic-number gap, review finding #28).

```
MaxArtifacts             = 3     // artifact row cap (§1 PlayerState)
MaxInscriptions          = 3     // inscription row cap (§1 PlayerState; §3 Sigils)
MaxDeathWaves            = 16    // death-cascade iteration cap (§4 ⑦)
StartingHeroHealth       = 30    // each hero's starting AND maximum health (§1 PlayerState.health; the HealAction cap, #12)
StartingHandFirstPlayer  = 3     // opening hand dealt to the player going first
StartingHandSecondPlayer = 4     // opening hand dealt to the player going second (who also gets The Coin — Match Setup)
HandCap                  = 10    // max hand size; an 11th card is burned (HandOverflowEvent; also the full-hand bounce/give bound, #21)
MaxMana                  = 10    // mana-crystal ceiling (maxMana ramp cap; Turn Lifecycle step 4)
StartingMana             = 1     // turn-1 mana/maxMana seeded for the first player at setup
DeckSize                 = 30    // exact decklist size the engine asserts at init
MaxCopiesPerCard         = 2     // per-definitionKey copy limit (1 for a Legendary) — primarily server-side deck validation, asserted here as a guard
NeutralFirstSpawnTurn    = 3     // default NeutralZoneConfig.firstSpawnTurn — end of P1's second turn
```

### PlayerState

```
playerId, heroClass: string
health, mana, maxMana: int    // health: init = max = GameConstants.StartingHeroHealth (30); a HealAction caps a hero at this max (#12 — the minion "healed up to maxHealth" rule applied to heroes), armor (below) being the only over-cap. mana/maxMana: 0 at setup, turn-1 seeded to StartingMana (1) for the first player (Match Setup), thereafter refreshed at turn-END (Turn Lifecycle step 4); mana MAY exceed maxMana via a gain such as The Coin (§2A ModifyManaAction, #22). (Hero entity-id addressing convention is review finding #12, walked separately.)
armor: int                    // hero damage ABSORBER (init 0, no cap): depleted before health at the §4 ④ damage-modifier precedence (hero slot — the minion analogue is Divine Shield). Gained only via GainArmorAction. NOTE heroes have NO attack stat, NO weapon, NO frozen state — heroes never attack (hero-weapon concept dropped 2026-06-11; the hero kit is the artifact row below)
hand: Card[]
deck: Card[]
board: MinionOnBoard[]        // player's own side only; ordered left to right
graveyard: GraveyardEntry[]   // unified — minions + spells + artifacts
artifacts: ArtifactOnBoard[]  // the player's artifact row (own board section, NOT minions) — cap GameConstants.MaxArtifacts = 3
                              // incl. the STARTER artifact equipped at match setup (one shared definitionKey for every hero —
                              // the hero-power replacement, 2026-06-11). See ArtifactOnBoard.
inscriptions: Card[]          // the player's INSCRIBED sigils (§3 "Sigils", 2026-06-11): reactive cards pre-armed face-down.
                              // Cap GameConstants.MaxInscriptions = 3; ONE per definitionKey. The Card itself moves zones
                              // (hand → inscriptions → graveyard on reveal). Identity hidden from the opponent; existence/count
                              // public (§2B directed/public sigil events).
cardsPlayedThisTurn: int      // Combo tracking
fatigueCounter: int           // empty-deck-draw counter; init 0, persists all game, NEVER resets. Each draw from an empty deck does fatigueCounter++ THEN deals the new value to this hero (1,2,3,…) — see §2A DrawCardAction
```

### MinionOnBoard

```
minionId: string
definitionKey: string         // the SOLE link into the card-definition library — and to the ICardHandler that registers this minion's triggers/deathrattle/keyword-hooks (see note at end of block). NOT a Card.id: playing a card never transfers its id; tokens have a definitionKey but no Card.id (Identity section).
ownerId: string?              // null = neutral zone. A control effect (TakeControlAction) sets this to a player, moving the minion out of the neutral lane onto that player's board; it then dies to that player's graveyard.
bornNeutral: bool             // ORIGIN flag, NOT a zone read: true iff this minion was spawned-neutral by the system (SpawnNeutralMinionAction). Immutable; survives a control change. With ownerId, the SOLE input to the §4 ⑦ graveyard-routing rule. A player-card minion summoned INTO the neutral lane is NOT bornNeutral (deferred — see Unaddressed Features).
baseAttack, baseHealth: int   // immutable, from card definition
enchantments: StatModifier[]  // permanent buffs; Silence clears all
auraAttackBonus, auraHealthBonus: int  // recalculated each aura pass; never stored in enchantments
attack: int                   // = baseAttack + Σenchantments.attackDelta + auraAttackBonus
maxHealth: int                // = baseHealth + Σenchantments.healthDelta + auraHealthBonus. **currentHealth follows maxHealth changes (#13, HS-exact):** when maxHealth RISES by Δ (a health buff/enchant or aura grant), currentHealth += Δ (the missing-health gap is preserved); when it FALLS (buff/aura removal, Silence), currentHealth = min(currentHealth, newMaxHealth) — clamp down, existing damage persists, NO minimum (maxHealth ≤ 0 ⇒ mortally wounded — the aura-loss-death path). Unified: newCurrent = min(currentHealth + max(0, Δmax), newMax). Applied wherever maxHealth changes — BuffMinionAction ④, SilenceMinionAction ④ (strips enchants), the ⑥ aura recompute (Δ vs the previous pass). Damage/heal move currentHealth directly, never maxHealth.
currentHealth: int            // takes damage; healed up to maxHealth. ≤0 (or destroy-marked) ⇒ pending death: the minion stays ON the board — still targetable, countable, and keyword-active — until the next death-wave settle (§4 ⑦), not removed on the spot (amendment B). The two doom kinds differ in SAVABILITY (2026-06-12): ≤0 health = "mortally wounded" (fires MinionMortallyWoundedEvent, savable — heal before the settle); destroy-marked = FINAL (no event, no save; only preventable at the destroy action's ③′ declaration — §2A DestroyMinionAction)
keywords: string[]            // maintained EFFECTIVE view = intrinsicKeywords ∪ grantedKeywords ∪ auraKeywords; resolved to IKeyword at runtime; what the engine queries. (Keyword analog of effectiveTribes.)
intrinsicKeywords: string[]   // from the card definition, seeded at summon; Silence clears
grantedKeywords: string[]     // PERMANENT non-aura grants after summon; retained across a RetainEnchantments bounce; Silence clears. Aura grants are NOT here.
auraKeywords: string[]        // aura-granted, recomputed each aura pass; never persisted, never bounce-retained; Silence does not touch (they recompute). ANY keyword may be aura-granted — keywords are pulled from the effective view, never a bus subscription (§3 IKeyword; keyword-collapse 2026-06-02).
intrinsicTribes: Tribe        // copied from the card's tribes at summon; immutable; survives Silence
grantedTribes: Tribe          // permanent tribe grants ("becomes a Beast"); Silence clears to Tribe.None
auraTribes: Tribe             // recomputed each aura pass; never persisted (parallels auraAttackBonus); drops when the aura leaves
effectiveTribes: Tribe        // computed = intrinsicTribes | grantedTribes | auraTribes; all engine tribe checks use this
summoningSick: bool           // raw fact (replaces the old derived `canAttack` bool): true while this minion entered a board THIS turn and has not yet woken at its controller's turn-start. Set on board-entry by BOTH summon and control; cleared by the turn-start sweep (Turn Lifecycle step 7). Attack eligibility — including the Charge-any-target / Rush-minions-only distinction — is PULLED from effective keywords at §4 ③, never baked into a stored verdict here. Neutrals are never summoningSick (no turn of their own; command bypasses eligibility and retaliation is ungated).
attacksUsedThisTurn: int      // raw counter, incremented on each attack; reset at the controller's turn-start sweep. The ONLY attack-state stored on the minion — the per-turn attack BUDGET is deliberately NOT a field: it is PULLED from effective keywords at §4 ③ (Windfury → 2, else 1; extensible to future budget-granting keywords), so it can never desync from the keyword (silencing Windfury drops the budget to 1 on the spot). NOT consulted for a neutral commanded via CommandAttackAction — command is a card-granted activation, not the minion's own budget (§2A / §4 ③).
summonOrder: int              // monotonically increasing per session; used for trigger fire ordering
isFrozen: bool                // frozen → cannot attack (§4 ③ AttackerFrozen)
frozenOnTurn: int             // turn.number when the freeze landed (meaningful only while isFrozen); drives the end-of-turn thaw rule (Turn Lifecycle step 3 / §3 IKeyword Freeze)
rebornAvailable: bool         // the one-time Reborn charge — distinct from the "reborn" keyword tag, which persists. Initialized at summon to keywords.Contains("reborn"); the reborn-summon path summons with it false; consuming it (NOT the keyword) is what reborn does. See §4 ⑦.
// TRIGGERS — not stored as fields. This minion's ITrigger(s), Deathrattle, and keyword-hooks are registered into IEventBus by its ICardHandler (resolved via definitionKey) at summon (OnSummon, ④) and dropped when it leaves the board. Live by virtue of the board zone (§3 "Reactive Triggers, Interventions & Interception"). The bus carries only ITrigger; keywords are pulled from the effective `keywords` view (§3 IKeyword), not subscribed.
```

### ArtifactOnBoard

Artifacts (2026-06-11) **replace the hero-power system** — there is no `heroPower`/`UseHeroPowerAction`. A new first-class entity in its own per-player board section: **passive** (hosts triggers — and may host an `IAura`), **active** (activate → effects, optional mana cost and target), or **both**.

```
artifactId: string            // new entity-ref space (debug-trace prefix `a`)
definitionKey: string         // sole link to the definition + handler — registers triggers/auras on equip (zone-scoped,
                              // §3 "Reactive Triggers"), supplies activation effects + target selector + the cost formula
ownerId: string               // artifacts are always player-owned; there are no neutral artifacts
baseActivationCost: int?      // null = passive-only (not activatable). The EFFECTIVE activation cost is PULLED per
                              // activation from the definition's cost formula over (artifact, state) — default = base;
                              // the starter overrides with base + usesThisTurn (escalating draw). Validation and client
                              // preview read the same pull (§4 ③) — never a stored verdict.
durability: int?              // null = infinite. ONE counter; the definition declares which moment(s) consume a point —
                              // activation, trigger-fire, or both. Reaching 0 enqueues DestroyArtifactAction.
charges: int                  // generic accumulator, init 0 — instance state for quest-counter designs (mutated only via
                              // ModifyArtifactChargesAction → ArtifactChargesChangedEvent)
usesThisTurn: int             // activations this turn; reset at the controller's turn start (Turn Lifecycle step 8);
                              // feeds escalating-cost formulas. There is NO per-turn activation budget — cost and
                              // durability are the only limiters.
equippedOnTurn: int
// NOT combat entities: no attack/health — never attackers/defenders, never death-wave members, not Silence-able,
// not aura-RECEIVERS (nothing to buff). Removal = durability exhaustion, owner discard, or an explicit destroy effect.
```

### Card

```
id, name: string
definitionKey: string         // the only cross-entity link into the card-definition library (Identity section); distinct from `id`, which is the per-instance allocator
type: CardType                // Minion | Spell | Artifact   (Artifact replaced HeroPower, 2026-06-11; Weapon REMOVED 2026-06-11 — heroes never attack, no weapon cards exist)
rarity: CardRarity
tribes: Tribe                 // [Flags] intrinsic taxonomy from the definition; Tribe.None = tribeless (valid). Gameplay tag; NOT cleared by Silence. See "Tribes" below.
baseManaCost: int
baseAttack?, baseHealth?: int // Minion only
modifiers: StatModifier[]     // in-hand cost/stat changes; attack/healthDelta migrate to enchantments on play
grantedKeywords: string[]     // keywords carried over from a RetainEnchantments bounce/shuffle. On play, these migrate to the new minion's grantedKeywords (and keywords) — they are not part of the card's base definition.
effectiveCost: int            // max(0, baseManaCost + Σmodifiers.costDelta)
definition: JsonElement       // the card's definition body
handlerKey?: string
// REACTIVE TRIGGERS — a card whose definition carries a reactive ITrigger is a SIGIL (§3 "Sigils"). Its ICardHandler registers the trigger into IEventBus live-by-zone, dropped on play/discard/return; the SAME trigger behaves per zone: in HAND → the sigil may be INVOKED (player-choice intervention window); in the INSCRIPTIONS zone → it auto-resolves (an INSCRIPTION; player choices degrade to random — §3). Every sigil supports both deployments. (Most cards carry no reactive trigger and just sit inert in hand.)
```

### StatModifier (unified — used on both Card and MinionOnBoard)

```
sourceId: string
costDelta: int      // meaningful on Card only; ignored on board
attackDelta: int
healthDelta: int
```

### GraveyardEntry hierarchy

```
GraveyardEntry (abstract)
  turnPlayed: int
  // NO stored Card. The card form is FABRICATED on demand (the §1 Fabrication rule) at the
  // point of use — draw-from-graveyard, resurrect-as-card, re-equip, recast — minting a fresh
  // Card.id then, as a stage-④ action. (A pre-stored "originalCard" would be a pure function of
  // the subtype snapshot below — derived data that can only drift; eager minting would also burn
  // a Card.id per corpse that is never pulled.) Each subtype keeps its own ENTITY snapshot, the
  // single source of truth the fabrication reads.

GraveyardMinion : GraveyardEntry
  snapshot: MinionOnBoard   // full state at death; carries definitionKey → card fully derivable
  diedOnTurn: int

GraveyardSpell : GraveyardEntry
  definitionKey: string     // a spell has no board snapshot, so it stores its own identity here → card fabricated from this on recast

GraveyardArtifact : GraveyardEntry
  artifactState: ArtifactOnBoard // full snapshot (carries definitionKey → card derivable); both DISCARD and DESTROY land here
  destroyedOnTurn: int
```

### Supporting types

```
TurnState           — activePlayerId: string?, number: int   // activePlayerId null = the neutral lane's "turn" — held ONLY during the Interturn neutral handover (§4 Turn Lifecycle step 5): neither player is active, so neither player's triggers fire — only the neutral group does (§3 IEventBus). Never null while either player may submit an action.
TimerState          — secondsRemaining: int
PendingChoice       — waitingPlayerId: string, choiceType: ChoiceType, options: ChoiceOption[],
                       context: JsonElement  // stores effect continuation. Chained choices = a continuation issuing the next
                                             // StartChoiceAction — the future v2 card-crafting flow rides this unchanged
                                             // (see notes/2026-06-11-card-crafting-v2.md; v1 builds NOTHING for it)
PendingIntervention — respondingPlayerId: string, heldAction: GameAction?, candidates: InterventionCandidate[],
                       timeoutSeconds: int
                       // SET-VALUED window (2026-06-09): candidates = the responder's matching + affordable
                       // reactive hand cards offered this window (§4). The player plays ONE (card + its targets) or
                       // skips. heldAction null = post-reaction (re-offer loop); non-null = declaration-hold
                       // (re-declare loop). The window re-opens after each PLAY (the offer shrinks), never after a skip.
InterventionCandidate — cardId: string, targetIds: string[]
                       // one offered card + its ENGINE-COMPUTED legal targets (2026-06-10, visibility): at ⑥′ = the
                       // card's matched subjects from this action ∩ its (selector, cardinality) family, recomputed each
                       // re-offer pass against the current board; at ③′ = the card's own targeting (cancel/retarget-type
                       // cards target the held action itself). The SINGLE source for both the §4 ③ submit-validation
                       // (set membership) and the responder-directed InterventionPromptEvent (§2B) — so the client
                       // renders the offer with no game logic.
MulliganState       — player1Completed: bool, player2Completed: bool
EffectContext       — sourceId: string, sourcePlayerId: string, targetId: string?,
                       state: GameState (read-only), SpellDamageBonus: int
                       // BASE resolution context — passed to IEffect.Execute, ITargetSelector.Select, and keyword pulls (§3). `sourceId` is the unified entity ref (minion OR card) and `sourcePlayerId` its controller, set by the enqueuer from the action's own source fields (§3 "Source Attribution"). Id-based precisely because the source may be a minion, not a card.
CardPlayContext : EffectContext — + card: Card
                       // SUPERSET for ICardHandler.OnPlay only: adds the resolved Card the handler reads its `definition` from. Here card.id == sourceId and playerId == sourcePlayerId; it inherits targetId/state/SpellDamageBonus, so OnPlay can pass itself to the IEffects it dispatches and bake spell-damage at enqueue.
```

### Tribes

Tribes are **gameplay tags** (tribal synergies — "your Beasts get +1/+1", "Discover a Murloc"), queried by the engine during aura recalc and effect resolution. Unlike keywords, a tribe is **inert** — it carries no behavior of its own; all behavior lives in the cards that reference it. It is therefore a closed, designer-curated taxonomy rather than a string-keyed extension point, and is modeled as a `[Flags]` enum so multi-tribe membership, granting, and removal are bitwise operations.

```csharp
[Flags]
enum Tribe {
    None   = 0,        // tribeless — a valid state
    Beast  = 1 << 0,
    Demon  = 1 << 1,
    Murloc = 1 << 2,
    // … new tribes ship with the content release that adds their cards (new cards are a library version bump anyway)
}
```

A minion's effective tribes come from three sources, kept in separate fields so aura contributions never pollute persistent state (the same discipline as `auraAttackBonus`):

- **`intrinsicTribes`** — from the card definition, copied to the minion at summon; immutable. **Survives Silence** (a silenced Beast is still a Beast).
- **`grantedTribes`** — permanent grants from effects ("becomes a Beast in addition to its other types"). **Silence clears these to `Tribe.None`.**
- **`auraTribes`** — granted by an active `IAura` ("your other minions are also Beasts"); fully recomputed each aura pass, never persisted, drops automatically when the aura leaves.

`effectiveTribes = intrinsicTribes | grantedTribes | auraTribes`; all engine tribe checks read it, e.g. `(minion.effectiveTribes & Tribe.Beast) != 0`. Cards expose only `tribes: Tribe` (their intrinsic taxonomy, possibly `Tribe.None`); the three-way split exists only on `MinionOnBoard`. `Tribe.None` participates correctly in all the bitwise operations, so tribeless cards/minions need no special-casing.

### Presentation data (out of library scope)

Art, display description, and sound cues are **not** part of `CCG.GameLogic`. They never affect gameplay, and the client already carries `definitionKey` on every entity it renders, so it resolves these from the presentation catalog (owned by the Platform API) by `definitionKey` — exactly as it resolves card art. Keeping them out preserves the library's "standalone, no presentation dependencies" property: the engine emits `definitionKey`, the client joins on it. (`rarity` stays on `Card` because it is plausibly gameplay-relevant — e.g. "Discover a Legendary".)

### Card and Minion Identity

Cards and minions are independent entities with independent **but type-prefix-disjoint** ID allocators — so a bare instance id is globally unambiguous and the engine reads entity type from the id's prefix (§2A). They are linked only by a shared `definitionKey` (string — e.g. `"river_crocolisk"`, `"boar"`) into the card-definition library.

**Identity rules:**

- `Card.id` and `MinionOnBoard.minionId` are allocated from two distinct counters; **IDs are never reused** within a session.
- **ID format — type-prefixed, per-session monotonic, never reused:** minions `m0, m1, …`; cards `c0, c1, …`; artifacts `a0, a1, …`. **Neutral minions share the `m` allocator** — *every* minion (player-owned or neutral) has an `m`-id; neutrality is `ownerId == null`, **not** a separate id space, and the id is **stable across `TakeControlAction`** (control flips `ownerId`, never the id). The two **heroes/players** are the fixed seats **`p1` and `p2`** (= `GameState.player1`/`player2`): a hero **is** its player (its stats live on `PlayerState`), addressed by its `playerId`, with **no separate hero-entity id**. `playerId` is a **match-local seat**, never an external/account id — the Game Server maps account ↔ seat. `ownerId` ∈ {`p1`, `p2`, `null`} is the owner *field* (null = the neutral lane), not an entity id. The type-prefixes keep all instance ids globally disjoint, so the uniform `entityId` target field (§2A) resolves by id alone.
- The `definitionKey` field on `Card` and on `MinionOnBoard` points into the static card-definition library. It is the only cross-entity link.
- Playing a Card to summon a Minion does **not** transfer the Card's `id` to the minion. The Card leaves play (to graveyard or fabricated-elsewhere); the Minion is a new entity with a fresh `minionId`.
- Tokens (minions summoned by effects with no originating card) have a `minionId` and a `definitionKey`. There is no `Card.id` associated with them while on the board.
- A `GraveyardMinion` stores **no card** — only its `snapshot` (full death state, including `definitionKey`). Lineage-aware effects derive everything from it: "resummon the last minion that died" uses `snapshot.definitionKey` (a *new* `minionId` is allocated); "add the dead minion's *card* to hand" / resurrect-as-card **fabricates** a Card on demand from `snapshot` via the Fabrication rule above (minting a fresh `Card.id` at that moment). This holds uniformly for tokens and played-from-hand minions alike — `MinionOnBoard` never retains its originating Card, so the card form is always a fabrication, never a stored reference.

### Minion → Card Transitions (Bounce / Shuffle-In)

Any action that moves a minion off the board into a card-shaped zone (hand or deck) takes a `policy` parameter of type `MinionToCardPolicy`:

```
MinionToCardPolicy = Stripped | RetainEnchantments
```

The effect that triggers the transition decides which policy applies (e.g. a Sap-style spell uses `Stripped`; a Recall-style spell uses `RetainEnchantments`). The action itself encodes the policy; the handler implements both behaviours.

**Fabrication rule:** every minion→card transition fabricates a *new* Card with a freshly allocated `Card.id`. The minion's `minionId` is retired. Lineage to any earlier originating Card (if one existed) is not preserved on the fabricated Card.

**What's retained, by policy:**

| Field on the new Card | `Stripped` | `RetainEnchantments` |
|---|---|---|
| `definitionKey` | from minion | from minion |
| `modifiers` | `[]` | copy of minion's `enchantments` (costDelta set to 0; attack/healthDelta preserved) — plus any cost-affecting modifiers the spec extends to in future |
| `grantedKeywords` | `[]` | copy of minion's `grantedKeywords` |

**Always lost (under both policies):**

| Lost | Why |
|---|---|
| `currentHealth` damage | A Card has no current-health concept — only base + modifiers. The minion returns to full health on replay. |
| `auraAttackBonus`, `auraHealthBonus` | Auras are recalculated continuously and never persisted on the minion; off-board they cease to apply. |
| Aura-granted keywords | Granted by a live aura against board minions. Absent from `grantedKeywords`; vanish on transition. |
| `attacksUsedThisTurn`, `summoningSick`, `isFrozen`, `summonOrder` | Runtime board state with no Card-side equivalent. |
| Base keywords from the card definition | Re-derived on next play from the definition library, not carried on the Card. |

**Replay semantics:** when the fabricated Card is played again, the resulting minion inherits `grantedKeywords` from the Card into both `keywords` and `grantedKeywords` on the new minion, and inherits `modifiers` into the new minion's `enchantments`. The new minion always has a fresh `minionId`.

**Scope note — keyword grant tracking:** `grantedKeywords` only captures non-aura buffs (effects that mutate the minion permanently). Aura-applied keywords are never added to `grantedKeywords`; they live only in `keywords` and are rewritten on every aura recalculation. Silence clears both `keywords` and `grantedKeywords`. This design avoids any per-source ledger in v1; if a future card requires per-source attribution (e.g. "remove only the Taunt that Sergeant gave," not the base Taunt), the model must extend `grantedKeywords` to `KeywordGrant { sourceId, keyword }`.

## Section 2: Actions + Events

Actions are immutable commands (input layer). Events are immutable facts (output layer). Every state change is produced by an action and announced via one or more events. The client receives events only — never raw state diffs. Both are C# records.

### 2A. GameAction types

All actions carry a nullable `SourcePlayerId` (null = system-issued) and a `RequestedAt` timestamp. The engine infers entity type (minion vs hero vs card vs artifact) from the ID's **type-prefix** at processing time (`m*` minion, `c*` card, `a*` artifact, `p1`/`p2` hero — §1 "Card and Minion Identity") — actions do not carry type discriminators. A **hero** `targetId` is simply its `playerId` (the seat `p1`/`p2`); there is no separate hero id.

**ID convention:** a `cardId` / `minionId` / `targetId` field names an **existing instance** in a zone (a `Card.id`, a `MinionOnBoard.minionId`, …); a `definitionKey` field names a **library key to fabricate or summon from**, where no instance exists yet (summoning a token, generating a card into hand, equipping an artifact, transforming). The two are never interchangeable — see "Card and Minion Identity" (§1).

**Player-initiated:**

| Action | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `PlayCardAction` | playerId, cardId, targetId?. ③ the standard gate (turn ownership; `effectiveCost ≤ mana`; target ∈ the card's selector). **Two ④ branches by card + context — (1) Normal play = COMMITMENT (2026-06-13, #34):** pay mana (`ManaChangedEvent`), move the card **out of hand**, `cardsPlayedThisTurn++`, emit `CardPlayedEvent` (+ `SpellCastEvent` for a spell), write a **spell**'s `GraveyardSpell` entry **here** (so a countered spell is already in the graveyard during the window — both outcomes, user's pick), and **enqueue `ResolveCardAction { cardId, definitionKey, playerId, targetId? }`**. The card's **effects do NOT run here** — commitment and resolution are split so an interception can sit *between* them (the idiom `AttackAction` / `ActivateArtifactAction` already use: commit/pay at ④, enqueue the consequence; card plays were the odd one out). A **minion** card writes **no** graveyard entry at commitment (its body, summoned at resolution, grieves as a `GraveyardMinion` if it later dies — avoids a double entry). **(2) Inscribe** = playing a **sigil** outside a response window (§3 "Sigils"): same cost gate (pay-on-inscribe, the trigger fires free later); ③ additionally rejects `InscriptionSlotsFull` (row of 3) / `SigilAlreadyInscribed` (duplicate definitionKey); ④ moves the card hand → `inscriptions`, registers its reactive trigger (zone-entry, `birthEpoch` stamped), `cardsPlayedThisTurn++`, emits the owner-directed `SigilInscribedEvent` + public thin `InscriptionAddedEvent` **instead of** `CardPlayedEvent`/`SpellCastEvent` (identity-hidden) — a **terminal ④, no `ResolveCardAction`**. Playing a sigil from hand *inside* a window goes via `SubmitInterventionAction` (an **invocation**) instead. |
| `ResolveCardAction` | cardId, definitionKey, playerId, targetId? — **the resolution half of a card play** (enqueued by `PlayCardAction` ④, never submitted directly; 2026-06-13, #34). An ordinary queue citizen: **its ③′ is the counterspell window** — the held action is *this resolution*, so a trigger that cancels here is a true **Counterspell** (costs already sunk + card already spent at the play's ④), whereas a trigger that cancelled the earlier `PlayCardAction` ③′ *prevented the cast* (nothing sunk, card still in hand). The trigger's condition picks which; the pending `ResolveCardAction` **is** the MTG "spell on the stack" (no new zone — the queue is the zone). **④:** run the card's effects — a spell's effects, or a minion card's **summon + Battlecry** (the Battlecry is one level deeper, still synchronous-in-pipeline). **Fizzle** (cancelled at ③′ / illegal on resume — e.g. its target left): effects never run, emit `CardPlayFizzledEvent { playerId, cardId }`, **no refund** (mana stays spent; a spell's graveyard entry stays). A **minion** card that fizzles goes to the owner's graveyard **here** (built from its `definitionKey` + base stats — it never reached the board); a minion card that resolves writes nothing here. |
| `AttackAction` | attackerId, targetId. **Handler (④), after ③ re-validation:** (1) snapshot the attacker's effective **base attack** (HS-style attack-lock; damage *modifiers* are pulled later, per `DealDamageAction` ④); (2) **consume the activation** — `attacksUsedThisTurn++`; (3) **break Stealth** if the attacker has it — an own-moment of *attacking*: clear the Stealth keyword and emit `StealthBrokenEvent` (attacking is what drops Stealth; merely being targeted/dealing non-attack damage does not — closes the Stealth half of hole #4); (4) emit `AttackPerformedEvent { attackerId, targetId }` (the post-interception **actual** target); (5) **enqueue two independent `DealDamageAction`s** — the strike (attacker → target, amount = the snapshotted attack) and, iff the defender's attack > 0, the retaliation (defender → attacker) — processed **sequentially, not atomically** (§3). **Freeze interaction:** a frozen attacker never reaches ④ (rejected at §4 ③ `AttackerFrozen`); conversely the `attacksUsedThisTurn` consumed in step 2 feeds the end-of-turn unfreeze sweep (Turn Lifecycle step 3) — a minion frozen **this turn while exhausted** (it had already swung) **stays** frozen through its next turn, one frozen while it **still had an attack thaws** at the end of this turn, so Freeze costs exactly one attack. |
| `ActivateArtifactAction` | playerId, artifactId, targetId? — activate an **active** artifact (replaces `UseHeroPowerAction`, 2026-06-11). ③: own turn; artifact owned; activatable (`baseActivationCost != null`, else `ArtifactNotActive`); **pulled effective cost** ≤ `mana` (the definition's cost formula — the starter's = `base + usesThisTurn`); target ∈ the definition's selector. ④: pay the pulled cost, `usesThisTurn++`, enqueue the definition's activation effects, consume `durability` if activation is a declared consumer (`ArtifactDurabilityLostEvent`; at 0 → enqueue `DestroyArtifactAction`), emit `ArtifactActivatedEvent`. **Unlimited per turn** (no budget field — cost/durability limit it); does **not** increment `cardsPlayedThisTurn` (not a card play; Combo unaffected); declared at ③′ like any action (interceptable). |
| `DiscardArtifactAction` | playerId, artifactId — the owner's in-turn right to free a slot: own turn, **free**, unlimited per turn. Unregisters the artifact's triggers/auras, snapshots it to the owner's graveyard (`GraveyardArtifact`), emits `ArtifactDiscardedEvent` — and **only** that (never `ArtifactDestroyedEvent`; the voluntary/involuntary split is two disjoint event types, not a `cause` field — the session-7 idiom). |
| `EndTurnAction` | playerId |
| `SubmitMulliganAction` | playerId, cardIdsToKeep[] |
| `SubmitChoiceAction` | playerId, choiceId, selectedOptionId |
| `SubmitInterventionAction` | playerId, chosenCardId? (null = **skip** — ends the window loop), targetIds[]? — plays **one** card from the window's offer (`pendingIntervention.candidates`) plus that card's chosen targets (from its matched-subject set, cardinality-many; validated by the §4 ③ membership check against the candidate entry: `chosenCardId ∈ candidates`, `targetIds ⊆ that candidate's targetIds`). Accepted only from the responding player during `PendingIntervention`; **exempt** from the ③ turn-ownership check, and its cost is paid from the responder's **current `mana`** (the ordinary `effectiveCost ≤ mana` check — that pool is their next-turn mana, pre-loaded at the previous turn-end; see Turn Lifecycle). A **play** re-opens the window over the remaining offer; a **skip** ends it (§4 "PendingIntervention Interruption"). Playing a sigil this way is an **invocation** (§3 "Sigils"). |
| `SurrenderAction` | playerId |

**System/effect-issued** — emitted by `IEffect`/`ITrigger` implementations; processed through the same pipeline as player actions:

| Action | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `DrawCardAction` | playerId, sourceId? — single-card draw. ④ handler, three branches: **(a)** deck non-empty, hand has room → move the top card to hand, emit the owner-directed `CardDrawnEvent` + public thin `CardDrawnPublicEvent` (#2); **(b)** deck non-empty, hand full → burn it, emit `HandOverflowEvent`; **(c)** **deck empty → FATIGUE**: `fatigueCounter++`, emit `FatigueDamageEvent { amount = fatigueCounter }`, then enqueue `DealDamageAction { target = the player's hero, amount = fatigueCounter, sourceId = null }`. Fatigue is **sourceless** (null) even when an effect forced the draw, and carries **no special damage path** — routing through the one damage channel means it inherits ④ modifier precedence (so `PlayerState.armor` absorbs it automatically — the hero absorb slot), interception/⑥′ windows, and the hero → `HeroMortallyWoundedEvent` → ⑧ settle path (deck-out loss, incl. mutual-deckout draw, falls out for free). Empty-deck and full-hand are mutually exclusive per draw (no card drawn ⇒ nothing to burn). A multi-card "draw N" effect enqueues N `DrawCardAction`s, so each empty-deck one ticks fatigue once. |
| `DealDamageAction` | target: `entityId` **or** `ITargetSelector` (AoE — evaluated at ④ over the current board), amount, sourceId — **the one channel for all damage, combat included** (see §3 "Reactive…"). A selector-carrying instance is a single declared action → a single ③′ interception window. **Combat = two independent instances** (attacker strike + defender retaliation), each separately declared and processed sequentially — *not* one atomic unit (§3, 2026-06-06) |
| `HealAction` | targetId, amount, sourceId |
| `DestroyMinionAction` | minionId, sourceId? — the **fiat doom** (effect-text "destroy"; also what a Poisonous hook enqueues). ④ handler: sets the **marked-for-destruction flag** — no health change, **no event** (silent until `MinionDiedEvent` at the ⑦ settle; emphatically *not* `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent`, which is health-domain only — 2026-06-12, option A). **The mark is final:** no save clears it — heal is irrelevant (health untouched), and ⑦ collects a marked minion regardless of health (a marked minion that is *also* at ≤ 0 health is simply dead twice over). **The only counterplay is preventing the mark**: intercept this action at its ③′ declaration (cancel/retarget) before ④ applies it. Consumers of the flag: the §4 ③ aliveness check (a marked minion cannot *initiate* an attack; it still retaliates) and ⑦ Phase-1 collection. A future "cleanse the mark" effect would be an additive unmark action — rejected for v1 (Item-10 disposition: additive anytime). |
| `SummonMinionAction` | definitionKey, ownerId?, boardPosition, sourceId? |
| `GainArmorAction` | playerId, amount, sourceId? — the sole `armor` gain path (no cap): `armor += amount`, emit `ArmorGainedEvent`. Armor is *consumed* inside the `DealDamageAction` ④ handler (the precedence's hero absorb slot), never by this action |
| `EquipArtifactAction` | playerId, definitionKey, sourceId? — the one equip path: playing an Artifact **card** enqueues it, and effects (battlecries etc.) enqueue the same action. A **player play** onto a full row (3) rejects at ③ (`ArtifactSlotsFull` — discard first, the BoardFull analogue); an **effect-enqueued** equip onto a full row **fizzles** at ④ re-validation (the full-board-summon pattern). Handler: append to `artifacts[]`, register the definition's triggers/auras (zone-entry, `birthEpoch` stamped — §3), emit `ArtifactEquippedEvent`. **Match setup** equips each player's starter artifact via this action. |
| `DestroyArtifactAction` | artifactId, sourceId? — system/effect destruction + the durability-exhaustion path: unregister triggers/auras, snapshot → owner's graveyard (`GraveyardArtifact`), emit `ArtifactDestroyedEvent` (never `ArtifactDiscardedEvent`). |
| `ModifyArtifactChargesAction` | artifactId, delta, sourceId — the sole `charges` mutation path → `ArtifactChargesChangedEvent`. (The dual-artifact example: passive trigger "a neutral minion dies" enqueues `+1`; active "deal `charges` damage to target", durability 3 consumed by activation.) |
| `GiveCardAction` | playerId, definitionKey, sourceId? — fabricate a card into the player's hand (hand-cap rules as for draw); emit the owner-directed `CardAddedToHandEvent` + public thin `CardAddedToHandPublicEvent` (#2) |
| `ReturnToHandAction` | minionId, policy: MinionToCardPolicy, sourceId? |
| `TransformMinionAction` | minionId, newDefinitionKey, sourceId? |
| `TakeControlAction` | minionId, newOwnerId, boardPosition?, sourceId? — **CONTROL** (permanent): re-homes the minion onto `newOwnerId`'s board and sets `ownerId`. The card's `ITargetSelector` defines legal `minionId` (neutral-only = `AllNeutralMinions`, enemy-only = `AllEnemyMinions`, either = `Union(...)`; no new selectors). Handler: reject `BoardFull` if the destination is full; else set `ownerId`, move zones, mark the minion **summoning-sick** (`summoningSick = true`) — whether it may act this turn is the ordinary pulled eligibility (Charge → any target, Rush → minions only) at §4 ③, *not* decided here — **re-bucket** its existing trigger subscriptions under the new owner (the bus orders firing by each host's owner vs. the active player, so however it tracks ownership it must now reflect `newOwnerId`) — this is **not** a re-run of `OnSummon`: triggers are neither re-created nor re-fired, and their `birthEpoch` is **preserved** (a moved entity, not a new one) — aura-recalc, emit `MinionControlChangedEvent`. The minion is now non-neutral and dies to `newOwnerId`'s graveyard. |
| `CommandAttackAction` | attackerId (a neutral), targetId, sourceId — **COMMAND** (one-shot, no zone change): a card-granted single attack *activation* by a neutral minion. Effect-issued. Re-validates at §4 ③ with the **relaxed attacker rule** (a neutral may attack only via this action; never via player `AttackAction`); legal `targetId` = anything a controlled minion could attack (opponent characters incl. hero, or another neutral) under the same **per-lane Taunt** rule. Honors the attacker's keywords: a **Windfury** neutral makes **two** strikes at the one target, **sequenced independently** — the second re-validates, so a mortal wound from the first retaliation fizzles it (§4 ③ aliveness). Ignores `attacksUsedThisTurn` and bypasses summoning-sickness entirely (neutrals are never `summoningSick`) — command is a card-granted activation, not the minion's own budget. Desugars into the same combat `DealDamageAction` pair(s) as `AttackAction`, so retaliation lands normally. |
| `BuffMinionAction` | minionId, attackDelta, healthDelta, sourceId — appends a permanent `StatModifier` to the minion's `enchantments` and recomputes `attack`/`maxHealth`; `currentHealth` follows the `maxHealth` change per the **#13 rule** (§1 `maxHealth`). |
| `SilenceMinionAction` | minionId, sourceId? |
| `FreezeTargetAction` | targetId (a **minionId** — heroes cannot be frozen: heroes never attack (2026-06-11), so freeze has nothing to deny them), sourceId? — sets `isFrozen = true` and stamps `frozenOnTurn = turn.number` on the target; emits `MinionFrozenEvent`. Thawing is the end-of-turn unfreeze sweep (Turn Lifecycle step 3), never here. |
| `ModifyManaAction` | playerId, delta, sourceId? — the sole arbitrary-`mana` mutation path (**The Coin** = `delta +1`). **Clamping (#22):** `mana` floors at **0** (a negative delta cannot push it below 0) and has **no ceiling** — a gain MAY exceed `maxMana` (The Coin can leave the second player above their crystal count, HS-faithful). It never touches `maxMana` (the ramp is a turn-end concern, Turn Lifecycle step 4). Emits `ManaChangedEvent`. |
| `ShuffleDeckAction` | playerId, sourceId? |
| `DiscardCardAction` | playerId, cardId? (null = random), sourceId? |
| `SpawnNeutralMinionAction` | definitionKey? (null ⇒ draw one uniformly **with replacement** from `neutralZoneConfig.spawnPool` via this action's ④ `IRandom` — the neutral-handover refill path enqueues `maxCapacity − currentCount` of these with a null key, Turn Lifecycle step 5), position?, sourceId? — summons a minion into the neutral lane (`ownerId = null`, `bornNeutral = true`), entering the board through the **same routine as a regular summon** (registers its `ICardHandler` triggers/keywords; `summoningSick` is moot — neutrals have no turn). Emits the regular **`MinionSummonedEvent` with `ownerId == null`** — *not* a neutral-specific event — so summon-watching mechanics fire out of the box. A summon, not a play ⇒ no Battlecry (matches `SummonMinionAction`). |
| `StartChoiceAction` | waitingPlayerId, choiceType, options[], context. Its ④ handler emits the chooser-directed `ChoicePromptEvent` (options) + the public thin `ChoiceStartedEvent` (optionCount) — §2B "Directed events" |
| `StartInterventionAction` | respondingPlayerId, heldAction? (null = post-reaction window — nothing held, e.g. a dying-window save), candidates[] (`{cardId, targetIds[]}` — the responder's matching + affordable hand cards with their engine-computed legal targets, §1 `InterventionCandidate`), causeEventIds[]? (⑥′ only — the matched events the window is *about*), timeoutSeconds. Its ④ handler emits the responder-directed `InterventionPromptEvent` + the public thin `InterventionWindowOpenedEvent` (§2B) |

### 2B. GameEvent types

All events carry an `eventId: long` (append-order sequence number, unique per session — the stable reference other artifacts use to point at an event, e.g. the ⑥′ intervention prompt's `causeEventIds[]`), an `OccurredAt` timestamp, and an `originEpoch: int` (the `currentActionEpoch` of the action that produced the event; used by `IEventBus` for creation-epoch visibility filtering — see §3 `IEventBus`). Events are append-only.

**Bus ⊋ log.** Almost every event below is a **handler-produced state delta** (emitted at ⑤) and populates the append-only **event log** — the client wire format and replay archive. The bus, however, carries a *superset*: the lone **`ActionDeclaredEvent`** is a transient **pre-execution interception signal** (emitted at ③′, before any state change) that rides the bus only so `ITrigger`s can subscribe — it is **excluded from the persisted event log and the client wire format**, because it represents intent, not a delta. So "the event log is exactly the state-delta stream" stays true even though the bus delivers one extra signal type.

**Directed events (2026-06-10, intervention visibility).** Most events broadcast to both players' wire streams (and spectators/replay). A few are **directed**: delivered only to one player's wire and absent from the opponent's and the spectator stream — the pattern the mulligan events already used ("each with only their own options"). Directed in v1: `MulliganStartedEvent`, `ChoicePromptEvent`, `InterventionPromptEvent`, `SigilInscribedEvent`, `CardDrawnEvent`, `CardAddedToHandEvent` (the last two added 2026-06-13, #2) — each paired with a public thin sibling where the opponent/spectators still need the bare fact (`ChoiceStartedEvent`, `InterventionWindowOpenedEvent`, `InscriptionAddedEvent`, `CardDrawnPublicEvent`, `CardAddedToHandPublicEvent` respectively). The library marks directedness on the event type; the Game Server's per-player fan-out honors it (the split exists precisely so a prompt's private payload — Discover options, intervention candidates — never crosses to the other wire). `eventId`s are assigned globally at append, so directed filtering never renumbers anyone's stream.

**Lifecycle:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `GameStartedEvent` | sessionId, player1Id, player2Id |
| `GameEndedEvent` | winnerId?, reason (Surrender/Defeat/Draw/Timeout/NoContest) |
| `TurnStartedEvent` | activePlayerId, turnNumber |
| `TurnEndedEvent` | activePlayerId, turnNumber |
| `MulliganStartedEvent` | playerId, options[] — fired once per player, each with only their own options |
| `MulliganCompletedEvent` | playerId |

**Cards / Hand:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `CardDrawnEvent` | **directed → owner**: playerId, card — the drawer sees the card; everyone else gets the public thin `CardDrawnPublicEvent` (2026-06-13, #2 — closes the hand-reveal leak: a single broadcast event carrying `card` would expose the drawn card to the opponent, contradicting ⑥′'s own no-expose rule) |
| `CardDrawnPublicEvent` | **public thin**: playerId — "drew a card" (identity hidden); the sibling broadcast to the opponent + spectators |
| `CardAddedToHandEvent` | **directed → owner**: playerId, card (given by effect, not drawn) — owner sees the card; everyone else gets the public thin `CardAddedToHandPublicEvent` |
| `CardAddedToHandPublicEvent` | **public thin**: playerId — "gained a card" (identity hidden) |
| `HandOverflowEvent` | playerId, burnedCard — **public** (HS reveals the burned card to both players) |
| `FatigueDamageEvent` | playerId, amount — the empty-deck draw outcome (sibling of `HandOverflowEvent`): announces the `fatigueCounter` bump (amount = the new counter) and telegraphs the impending self-damage. Fires at the `DrawCardAction` ④ handler **before** the enqueued fatigue `DealDamageAction` lands its `DamageTakenEvent` (same shape as `AttackPerformedEvent` → `DamageTakenEvent`). The dedicated event — not a flag on `DamageTakenEvent` — is how the client/telemetry knows a hero hit was fatigue (no damage-`cause` discriminator exists; see §2B Mana/Hero note). |
| `CardPlayedEvent` | playerId, card, targetId? — emitted at `PlayCardAction` **④** (commitment; 2026-06-13, #34). **Not** emitted for an inscribe play (identity-hidden; the §2B sigil events replace it — §3 "Sigils") |
| `CardPlayFizzledEvent` | playerId, cardId — a committed card play whose enqueued `ResolveCardAction` was **cancelled** (true Counterspell) or became **illegal** on resume: effects never run and there is **no refund** — mana stays spent, the card stays out of hand, any spell graveyard entry stays (the commitment deltas already fired at the play's ④). §2A `PlayCardAction`/`ResolveCardAction`, 2026-06-13, #34 |
| `CardDiscardedEvent` | playerId, card — **public** (HS reveals a discarded card to both players) |
| `CardReturnedToHandEvent` | playerId, card (bounced from board) |
| `CardShuffledIntoDeckEvent` | playerId, card |

**Board:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `MinionSummonedEvent` | minion, ownerId? — **the single summon event for every lane, neutral included** (`ownerId == null` ⇒ summoned into the neutral lane). A neutral spawn (`SpawnNeutralMinionAction`) emits this same event, so any "when a minion is summoned" trigger — including a lane-based `FriendlyOnly` one on a neutral minion reacting to its lane-mates — catches it out of the box. There is **no** separate neutral-summon event (the principle: the neutral lane behaves like a regular lane so mechanics work without special-casing). |
| `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent` | minionId, sourceId — fires the instant a minion enters **health-domain** pending-death (`currentHealth ≤ 0` — from damage, or from a buff/aura loss collapsing `maxHealth` to ≤ 0), **before** the death-wave settle removes it; distinct from `MinionDiedEvent` (Phase-1 removal). The hook for dying-window reactions — e.g. a **save-from-lethal** intervention (the "R1" avenue: heal a mortally-wounded minion back above 0 before the settle). **A destroy-mark does NOT fire this event (narrowed 2026-06-12, option A):** fiat dooms are unsavable, so no dying window may open to bait a futile save — a marked minion is silent until `MinionDiedEvent` at the settle; its counterplay window was the `DestroyMinionAction`'s own ③′ declaration. (No `cause` discriminator — and with marks excluded, every remaining cause is a health crossing, genuinely indistinguishable-by-need; see Mana/Hero note below.) |
| `MinionDiedEvent` | minionId, snapshot, sourceId, diedOnTurn |
| `MinionTransformedEvent` | minionId, newCard |
| `MinionControlChangedEvent` | minionId, fromOwnerId? (null = was neutral), toOwnerId — emitted by `TakeControlAction` after the minion is re-homed onto its new owner's board (summoning-sick on arrival; it may still act this turn if it has Charge/Rush — pulled at §4 ③). A commanded attack (`CommandAttackAction`) does **not** emit this — it changes no owner — it rides the ordinary combat events. |
| `NeutralZoneRepopulatedEvent` | spawnedMinions[] — **renderer-only batch marker** for a neutral-zone repopulation at the **Interturn handover** (§4 Turn Lifecycle step 5 — the neutral lane's own "turn", `activePlayerId = none`); carries no mechanic. The actual per-minion summons go through `SpawnNeutralMinionAction` → one `MinionSummonedEvent` each (so summon-watching triggers fire normally); this event is an optional summary the client may use to animate the batch. *(The former separate `NeutralMinionSpawnedEvent` was removed — a neutral spawn is just a `MinionSummonedEvent` with `ownerId == null`.)* |
| `DeathWaveStartedEvent` | waveIndex |
| `DeathWaveEndedEvent` | waveIndex, minionsResolved |
| `StabilizationAbortedEvent` | wavesReached, lastWaveMinionIds[] — fatal; always immediately followed by `GameEndedEvent { reason: NoContest }` |

**Combat:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `AttackDeclaredEvent` | attackerId, targetId — the combat-specific **declaration**, published at `AttackAction` **③′** (the *intended*, pre-interception target): the typed hook for "when this attacks" interception (e.g. a redirect). **Bus-only: not a state delta — excluded from the persisted event log and client wire format** (treated exactly like `ActionDeclaredEvent`; 2026-06-13, #5 — preserves the "event log = state-delta stream" invariant, no third visibility class). Renderer coverage without it: no window → `AttackPerformedEvent` (④, committed) anchors the animation with no perceivable gap; during a window → the directed `InterventionPromptEvent` + the public `InterventionWindowOpenedEvent` (which carries the cause). May still fizzle/retarget before ④. |
| `AttackPerformedEvent` | attackerId, targetId — the **committed** swing, emitted at `AttackAction` **④** (the post-interception *actual* target). Announces the activation-consumed delta (`attacksUsedThisTurn++`) and is the natural anchor for a future "after this attacks" trigger. The swing's **damage is not here** — it lands via the two enqueued `DealDamageAction`s' own `DamageTakenEvent`s. **Replaces the removed `AttackResolvedEvent`**, which bundled both hit amounts into a single delta — impossible under two-action combat, where neither hit has landed at ④ and a card may interleave between them. |
| `DamageTakenEvent` | targetId, amount, armorAbsorbed, overkill, sourceId — `armorAbsorbed` = the portion eaten by hero `armor` at the ④ absorb slot (always 0 for minion targets / unarmored heroes); health loss = `amount − armorAbsorbed`. A **field**, not a separate armor-loss event — same idiom as `overkill` (one occurrence, split delta), distinct from the disjoint-event idiom (discard vs destroy), which is for *different occurrences* |
| `HealedEvent` | targetId, amount, sourceId |

**Status / Keywords:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `MinionSilencedEvent` | minionId |
| `MinionFrozenEvent` | minionId |
| `MinionThawedEvent` | minionId — frozen status cleared by the end-of-turn unfreeze sweep (Turn Lifecycle step 3). |
| `DivineShieldBrokenEvent` | minionId |
| `StealthBrokenEvent` | minionId — Stealth keyword cleared because the minion attacked (`AttackAction` ④). Parallels `DivineShieldBrokenEvent` (a one-time keyword consumption). |
| `EnrageStateChangedEvent` | minionId, isEnraged |
| `MinionStatsChangedEvent` | minionId (signals aura recalc needed) |

**Mana / Hero:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `ManaChangedEvent` | playerId, mana, maxMana |
| `HeroMortallyWoundedEvent` | playerId, sourceId — fires the instant a hero crosses to ≤0 health (from any damage — combat, spell, fatigue, self-damage), **before** the ⑧ win-check finalizes the loss; the hero analogue of `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent`, distinct from `GameEndedEvent` (the ⑧ finalization). The hook for save-the-hero reactions (heal-above-0 / immune in response to lethal — e.g. an Ice-Block-style effect realised as a post-reaction rather than damage prevention; for prevention see "Interception", §3). **No `cause` discriminator:** it was informational only (no card branches on it; save-from-lethal fires regardless of cause) and nothing in the engine populated it. Fatigue is identified by the `FatigueDamageEvent` that immediately precedes its `DealDamageAction`; other causes are reconstructable from the source/preceding events. Dropped rather than fed by a damage-cause taxonomy (YAGNI). |
| `ArmorGainedEvent` | playerId, amount — armor *loss* is not a separate event: absorption rides `DamageTakenEvent.armorAbsorbed` |

**Artifacts** (replace the HeroPower events, 2026-06-11):

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `ArtifactEquippedEvent` | playerId, artifact |
| `ArtifactActivatedEvent` | playerId, artifactId, targetId? — the activation delta and the subscription point for `OnArtifactActivated` triggers (the renamed Inspire; no separate `InspireTriggeredEvent`-style marker — the activation event itself is the hook) |
| `ArtifactDurabilityLostEvent` | artifactId, remainingDurability — the `remaining: 0` tick immediately precedes the enqueued `DestroyArtifactAction` |
| `ArtifactChargesChangedEvent` | artifactId, newCharges, delta |
| `ArtifactDiscardedEvent` | playerId, artifactId — **voluntary** removal only (owner's in-turn discard). Disjoint from `ArtifactDestroyedEvent` — never both; "leaves play for any reason" subscribes to both |
| `ArtifactDestroyedEvent` | playerId, artifact (snapshot) — **involuntary** removal: durability exhaustion or a destroy effect |

**Sigils** (§3 "Sigils", 2026-06-11):

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `SigilInscribedEvent` | **directed → owner only**: playerId, card — the full echo of the inscribed card (mulligan-style delivery; §2B "Directed events") |
| `InscriptionAddedEvent` | playerId — the **public thin form**: existence/count only, identity stays hidden (the face-down tell; unmaskable anyway — the mana delta is public state) |
| `SigilRevealedEvent` | playerId, card — **public** reveal at fire time, emitted immediately before the inscription's response actions resolve; the card then moves `inscriptions` → graveyard (one-shot; `GraveyardSpell` as-is) |

**Effects / Triggers:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `SpellCastEvent` | playerId, cardId, targetId? |
| `BattlecryTriggeredEvent` | minionId |
| `DeathrattleTriggeredEvent` | minionId |
| `ComboTriggeredEvent` | cardId, playerId |
| `ActionDeclaredEvent` | action — the universal **pre-execution** signal: published at stage **③′** (§4) for every dispatched action *after* it validates and *before* it executes (④), carrying the action itself. The single hook for **interception** (declaration-phase) reactions; subscribers filter on the carried action's runtime type/params via the condition library, so **no per-action-type `*Declared` taxonomy is required**. Published afresh on **each (re-)declaration**: a held action resumed after a responder *played* an intervention re-validates and, if still legal, **re-declares** — re-publishing this event so the responder's remaining reactive cards get another window (the session-6 **re-declare loop**, §4 ③′); a **skip/timeout** resumes the held action without re-declaring. Redirect/inscription loops are bounded not by suppressing re-declaration but by the **depth-1 nesting cap** (a response opens no further *player* window on itself) plus the responder's finite mana. **Bus-only: not a state delta, so excluded from the persisted event log and client wire format** (see the "Bus ⊋ log" note above). (The typed `AttackDeclaredEvent` is the combat-specific declaration at the same ③′ timing — the typed "when this attacks" interception hook, bus-only per #5; it is *not* a renderer convenience and *not* the general hook — `ActionDeclaredEvent` is the general hook, `AttackDeclaredEvent` the typed combat-specific one, both mechanically load-bearing.) |

**Choice / Intervention:**

| Event | Key fields |
|---|---|
| `ChoiceStartedEvent` | waitingPlayerId, choiceType, optionCount — **public thin form** (2026-06-10): "choosing among N" is all anyone else sees. The options themselves are deliberately **not** here — a broadcast `options[]` would leak Discover options to the opponent |
| `ChoicePromptEvent` | **directed → waiting player only**: waitingPlayerId, choiceType, options[] — the renderable prompt (mulligan-style directed delivery; §2B "Directed events") |
| `ChoiceResolvedEvent` | waitingPlayerId, selectedOptionId — public; opaque to the opponent without the directed `options[]` |
| `InterventionWindowOpenedEvent` | respondingPlayerId, **cause**, timeoutSeconds — **public thin form**: a window exists, its **cause**, and its clock. The cause is the **held action verbatim** at ③′ / `causeEventIds[]` refs at ⑥′ — the *actor's* info (public-by-nature per the session-8 ③′ ruling), never the *responder's* candidates; the inscribe-redaction carve-out applies. The acting player thereby learns *a* matching reactive card exists for this action (the accepted contingent-window tell — Arena/Master-Duel camp, decided 2026-06-10) but never which; UX-layer masking is a server option, no engine change. Carrying the cause closes the spectator/replay gap for a **cancelled no-delta action** (2026-06-13, #5/#34 window-cause rider) |
| `InterventionPromptEvent` | **directed → responder only**: respondingPlayerId, cause (the **held action verbatim** at ③′ \| `causeEventIds[]` at ⑥′ — refs into the responder's own wire, never re-embedded payloads), candidates[] (`{cardId, targetIds[]}`, engine-computed), timeoutSeconds — everything the client needs to render the window with no game logic (§3 visibility; §4 ③′/⑥′) |
| `InterventionWindowClosedEvent` | respondingPlayerId, wasSkipped — public (harmless: a skip is observationally inferable anyway — nothing resolved) |
| `InterventionPlayedEvent` | respondingPlayerId, cardId |

### 2C. Action Rejection

When validation (§4 ②③) fails, the action is rejected with a **structured code** — never an English string baked into the engine. A rejection is the negative arm of `Submit`'s return; it is **not** a `GameEvent`, never touches the event bus, and never enters the event log. (Rejected actions cause no state change, so on replay they simply re-reject — consistent with Item 6's "log = real state-changing player actions only".)

```csharp
enum ActionRejectionCode {
    WrongPhase, NotActivePlayer, CardNotInHand, NotEnoughMana,
    InvalidTarget, TargetStealthed, MustTargetTaunt,
    AttackerNotAlive, AttackerNotControlled, AttackerCannotAttack, RushCannotTargetHero, AttackerFrozen, AttackerExhausted, BoardFull,
    ArtifactSlotsFull, ArtifactNotActive,
    InscriptionSlotsFull, SigilAlreadyInscribed,
    // … closed set; grows in lockstep with the §4 ②③ validation rules
}

record ActionRejection(ActionRejectionCode Code, string? Detail = null);
```

`Code` is **the contract**: tests assert on it, and the Game Server maps it to a localized client string. **`Detail` is optional, free-form, and explicitly non-contractual** — a human-readable diagnostic for logs only (e.g. `"needs 5, has 3"`). It is never asserted in tests and never shown to users (clients localize from `Code`), and may be `null`. Anything richer — typed per-code payloads — is deliberately out of scope for v1: the data is reconstructable by the caller from `(action, state)`, so a *specific* code can be upgraded to carry structured context later if one is ever found that genuinely cannot. The whole-mechanism version is not built up front.

`Submit` returns a discriminated result rather than a bare event list:

```csharp
SubmitResult = Accepted(IReadOnlyList<GameEvent> events)
             | Rejected(ActionRejection rejection);
```

The pure validation predicate (§4 ③) returns `Ok | Rejection` using this same `ActionRejection`; `Submit` wraps a non-`Ok` predicate result into `Rejected` without ever entering stage ④. The Game Server relays the `Rejected` result to the originating client as the response to its request.

---

## Section 3: Engine Architecture

A small set of interfaces forms the engine: the **extensibility layer** (`IKeyword`, `IEffect`, `ITrigger` with its `ITriggerCondition`, `ITargetSelector`, `IAura`, `ICardHandler`) plus the **infrastructure backbone** (`IActionHandler`, `IEventBus`, `IActionQueue`, `IRandom`).

### `IActionHandler<TAction>`

One handler per action type. Receives an action and the current `GameState`, mutates state, and returns the events produced. All state mutation in the engine happens inside action handlers — nowhere else.

```csharp
interface IActionHandler<TAction> where TAction : GameAction {
    IEnumerable<GameEvent> Handle(TAction action, GameState state);
}
```

### `IEventBus`

Broadcast backbone. Dispatches in the **canonical board order** (see Deterministic Ordering): three ordered groups per event type — the current (active) player's triggers, then the opponent's, then the **neutral zone's** — fired in that sequence, and within each group sorted by current board index at publish time (not at subscription time, so a minion that fills a vacated slot fires in the position it currently occupies). **Within each player's group, that player's artifact-hosted triggers fire after their minion-hosted ones** (artifact slot order `artifacts[0..2]` as the within-row index, mirroring board index; 2026-06-11), **and their inscription-hosted triggers after those** (inscription order `inscriptions[0..2]`; §3 "Sigils" — subject to the actor-attribution skip rule there) — artifacts and inscriptions append to their owner's existing bucket rather than forming new global groups, which preserves the active-player-first promise (an active player's artifact fires before any opponent trigger). The neutral group is the trigger-side counterpart of the neutral zone's last slot in the death sort; it makes trigger fire order and death sort order **one rule**. **Exception — the neutral handover (§4 Turn Lifecycle step 5, "Interturn"):** that step runs as the **neutral lane's own turn** with `turn.activePlayerId = none` (null). With no active player, the active and opponent groups are **empty** — so *neither* player's triggers fire on the neutral-lane repopulation, **only the neutral group does**. This is the exact dual of neutral minions being excluded from player turns (above): players are excluded from the neutral lane's turn. No cross-player ordering exists to bias — strictly fairer than any fixed seat order.

This applies to **board-wide event triggers** (on-damage, on-death, on-spell-cast, on-summon, …) — a neutral minion's `FriendlyOnly`-conditioned trigger fires off its **lane-mates** (friendly is lane-based; see `ITriggerCondition`), so neutral minions trigger off each other just as a player's do. It does **not** make neutral minions fire **turn/hero-context** triggers, which stay empty for want of a referent (not because of the friendly relation): **Start/End-of-Turn** (enumerated per player in the Turn Lifecycle — a neutral minion has no turn of its own), **OnArtifactActivated** (the renamed Inspire — "after *you* activate an artifact"; a neutral host has no artifact row of its own), **Combo** (no hand / turn play-count). This is all condition semantics, not a bus special-case. (Artifacts themselves, by contrast, participate in turn-scoped triggers normally — they have an owner with turns.)

```csharp
interface IEventBus {
    void Subscribe<TEvent>(string listenerId, Action<TEvent, GameState> handler);
    void Unsubscribe(string listenerId);
    void Publish<TEvent>(TEvent evt, GameState state);
}
```

**Publish-time snapshot + creation-epoch visibility.** On every `Publish(E)` the bus snapshots the relevant subscriber lists at that instant and iterates the copy — a listener registered while `E` is being dispatched does not receive `E`. Dispatch is then filtered by **creation epoch**, so a listener never receives an event produced by the same action that created it (most importantly, a minion never reacts to its own `MinionSummonedEvent`):

- `GameEngine` maintains a monotonic `currentActionEpoch`, incremented as each action begins processing (stage ④).
- Each subscriber is stamped `birthEpoch = currentActionEpoch` when `Subscribe` is called.
- Each event is stamped `originEpoch = currentActionEpoch` when its producing handler runs (alongside `OccurredAt`).
- `Publish(E)` dispatches to listener `L` **only if `L.birthEpoch < E.originEpoch`**.

Consequences: a listener receives only events from actions *strictly later* than the action that created it. Events already in flight from earlier actions are missed (the listener did not exist when they published); events from the *same* action — including the listener's own creation event and any sibling events — are excluded by the equal-epoch comparison; every subsequent action's events are received. This reproduces Hearthstone's rule (a freshly summoned or transformed minion does not trigger off the event that introduced it) **uniformly for every entity-introducing event**, with no per-event special-casing. Because the filter is a pointwise integer comparison against the *live* list, removed (unsubscribed) listeners are simply absent — there is no stale frozen list that could fire.

**Invariant — subscriptions happen only inside action handlers.** Every bus subscription occurs during stage ④ (`ICardHandler.OnSummon` registering this card's `ITrigger`s), so every listener has a well-defined `birthEpoch`. Nothing subscribes during event publication (⑤) or aura recalculation (⑥). This invariant is what makes the epoch comparison total. (Keywords do **not** subscribe — their behaviour is pulled at stage ④, see §3 `IKeyword` — so the bus carries only `ITrigger` subscriptions.)

### `IActionQueue`

Effects and triggers enqueue actions here — they never mutate state directly. Ensures every state change goes through an `IActionHandler` and produces auditable events.

```csharp
interface IActionQueue {
    void Enqueue(GameAction action);      // normal priority (back of queue)
    void EnqueueFront(GameAction action); // high priority (front of queue — death resolution only)
}
```

### `IKeyword`

Keywords are **declarative markers** on a minion's effective `keywords` view (intrinsic | granted | aura — see `MinionOnBoard`). A keyword **never subscribes to the event bus**; its behaviour is *pulled* at the minion's own action moments. This is the deliberate cut between the two extensibility points:

> **Keyword** — behaviour at the minion's *own* action moments (deal / take damage, attack, summon, stat recompute), read from declarative state and pulled by the relevant stage-④ handler.
> **Trigger** (`ITrigger`) — reaction to *board-wide* events, via a bus subscription with the creation-epoch filter.

Because keyword behaviour is always pulled from the **effective** view at the moment of use, **aura-granted keywords behave identically to intrinsic ones** (the aura contributes to `auraKeywords`, which is in the effective view), and a keyword on a minion that has left the board is simply never read. There is no subscription lifecycle and no registration-during-recalc problem — which is why aura grants are unrestricted (any keyword, not just "declarative" ones) and the epoch filter (§3 `IEventBus`) is needed only by `ITrigger`.

Behaviour attaches two ways.

**1. Inline reads** — most keywords are queried from the effective view at one decision point:

| Keyword | Read at |
|---|---|
| Taunt | attack validation (§4 ③ — opponent must attack a Taunt minion) |
| Stealth | two reads: (1) targeting validation — cannot be targeted by the opponent (`TargetStealthed`); (2) **broken when the minion attacks** — an own-moment cleared at `AttackAction` ④ (`StealthBrokenEvent`), like Divine Shield's one-time consumption. Being targeted or dealing non-attack damage does not break it. |
| Charge / Rush | pulled at attack eligibility (§4 ③) for a `summoningSick` minion: **Charge** → may attack any target (minion or hero); **Rush** → may attack a **minion only** (enemy or neutral) on the entry turn, never a hero. Not baked into a stored bool — pulling at the moment makes aura-granted or silenced haste correct with no recompute. |
| Windfury | pulled at attack eligibility (§4 ③): the per-turn attack **budget** = `effectiveKeywords has windfury ? 2 : 1` (extensible — e.g. a future Mega-Windfury → 4). Never stored on the minion, so it can't drift from the keyword; the eligibility check is `attacksUsedThisTurn < budget`. |
| Divine Shield | consumed inside `DealDamageAction`: if target has it → remove it, publish `DivineShieldBrokenEvent`, apply no damage |
| Spell Damage +X | *pulled* and aggregated at spell-resolution start (`EffectContext.SpellDamageBonus`); magnitude in the keyword string (`spell_damage:1`) |
| Reborn | read by `DeathResolutionService` Phase 3 (`keywords has reborn && rebornAvailable`); firing consumes `rebornAvailable`, the keyword persists (counts for auras, survives bounce/copy) |
| Enrage | a conditional buff recomputed in the stage-⑥ aura/stat pass from `currentHealth < maxHealth` (pulled live, not a stored `isDamaged` flag — the stored-verdict purge, 2026-06-13; not an event reaction) |

**2. Role-interface hooks** — a keyword whose behaviour *enqueues a follow-on action* at a specific moment implements a small hook interface. The owning action handler iterates the acting minion's **effective** keywords implementing that interface and invokes each — no subscription, all inside stage ④:

```csharp
interface IKeyword { string KeywordId { get; } }

// Invoked by DealDamageAction over the SOURCE's effective keywords, after damage applies.
interface IOnDealtDamage : IKeyword {
    void OnDealtDamage(string sourceId, string targetId, int amount,
                       GameState state, IActionQueue queue);
}
```

v1 hooks (`IOnDealtDamage`): **Lifesteal** → enqueue `HealAction` for the source's owner — **a no-op when the source is unowned (`ownerId == null`, a neutral minion): there is no hero to heal** (2026-06-13, #4); **Poisonous** → enqueue `DestroyMinionAction` on **any minion it damages, heroes excepted** (2026-06-13, #3: the relational "enemy" scope is removed — the lane model made "enemy" wrong for a neutral source; a minion is destroyed by the venom whichever side dealt it). The handler:

```csharp
ApplyDamage(target, amount);
foreach (var kw in EffectiveKeywords(source).OfType<IOnDealtDamage>())
    kw.OnDealtDamage(source, target, amount, state, queue);
```

Further "own-moment" hook points (on-take-damage, on-attack, …) are added as new role interfaces when a card first needs one; each is invoked the same way by its owning handler. **Freeze** is not a keyword hook — it is a status: `FreezeTargetAction` sets `isFrozen = true` and stamps `frozenOnTurn = turn.number` (`MinionFrozenEvent`), and a frozen minion cannot attack (§4 ③ `AttackerFrozen`). It thaws in the **end-of-turn unfreeze sweep** (§4 Turn Lifecycle step 3), which thaws the ending player's frozen minions **unless** the freeze landed *this* turn while the minion was already exhausted — so Freeze costs **exactly one attack**: a minion frozen with an attack still available misses that turn and thaws at its end, while one frozen *after* it has swung (e.g. into a retaliation-freezer) stays frozen through its next turn. Freeze is **minion-only**: heroes never attack (2026-06-11), so a hero has no attack for freeze to deny — there is no hero frozen state.

### `IEffect`

Atomic unit of "do something to game state." Used by card definitions and trigger implementations. Effects enqueue actions — they never mutate state.

```csharp
interface IEffect {
    void Execute(EffectContext context, IActionQueue queue);
}
```

`EffectContext` carries: `sourceId`, `sourcePlayerId`, `targetId?`, a read-only `GameState` reference, and `SpellDamageBonus: int`. (`sourceId` is the unified entity reference — formerly `sourceCardId`, generalized because a triggered effect's source is often a *minion*, not a card. See "Source Attribution" below.)

#### Source Attribution

Every action carries a `sourceId`, and `EffectContext` is built from the **action's own** source fields. Attribution follows one rule:

> **`sourceId` is the entity whose effect this is — set by whoever *enqueues* the action — and is never inherited from the upstream cause.**

- A played card's effects (including Battlecry) → `sourceId` = the card.
- A minion's triggered effects (Deathrattle, On-Damage, …) → `sourceId` = that minion. A trigger's `OnFire` stamps `sourceId = its host entity`; it does **not** pass along the source of the action that fired the trigger.
- Artifact effects → that artifact.
- `sourcePlayerId` = the source's controller, captured at enqueue time (from the death snapshot if the source is already dead).

So if Yeti's Deathrattle damages a minion, the damage's `sourceId` is **Yeti**, not the spell that killed Yeti. This determines friendly/enemy evaluation (Item 2 conditions), the Lifesteal heal target, and which entity "dealt" the damage for any watching trigger.

**Attribution ≠ keyword application.** `sourceId` is *data* on the event, so a watcher correctly credits Yeti even though Yeti is dead. But Lifesteal/Poisonous are **keyword hooks pulled from the source's effective keywords** (§3 `IKeyword`), and a dead Yeti is off the board — so `EffectiveKeywords(source)` is empty and the hooks do **not** fire for Yeti's own post-death Deathrattle damage. No listener lifecycle is involved; this falls out of "read effective keywords from live board state" with no special-casing. See "Unaddressed Features" for the case where a card would *want* dead-source keyword effects (enabled by a death-snapshot keyword fallback).

**`SpellDamageBonus`** is a read-only value computed **once at the start of spell resolution** and held on the context for the whole cast. Every `DealDamageEffect` in that spell reads the *same* snapshot and bakes the final number into its enqueued `DealDamageAction` (the action handler stays dumb — it applies the number it's given). Because the bonus is spell-scoped, not hit-scoped: a spell that deals damage twice still applies the bonus to both hits, and a spell that kills its own Spell-Power minion mid-cascade does not lose the bonus for its second half. It is `0` for any non-spell source, so it cannot leak into combat or artifact-activation damage.

The value is the aggregate, at snapshot time, of the caster's friendly **`spell_damage:X` keywords** in the effective `keywords` view — intrinsic *or* aura-granted (the latter via `auraKeywords`). **Player-scoped spell-damage sources** (e.g. "+1 to all spells this turn", "+3 to your next spell") are deliberately **out of scope here** — they belong to the future Modifier System (see `docs/superpowers/notes/2026-05-31-modifier-system.md`), because their scoped/consumable lifecycle is shared machinery with mana-cost reduction and should be designed once, for both, rather than baked into spell damage.

### `ITrigger`

Encapsulates "fire when event X occurs." Subscribes to a specific event type; may filter by game state condition.

```csharp
interface ITrigger {
    string TriggerType { get; }
    Type ListensTo { get; }
    bool ShouldFire(GameEvent evt, GameState state);
    void OnFire(GameEvent evt, GameState state, IActionQueue queue);
}
```

Covers the full trigger catalog: Battlecry, Deathrattle, Start of Turn, End of Turn, Aura (continuous, via `IAura`), On Damage Taken, On Friendly Minion Death, On Spell Cast, On Artifact Activated (the renamed Inspire — fires off `ArtifactActivatedEvent`), Combo. New trigger types are added by implementing this interface. `ShouldFire` is typically delegated to an `ITriggerCondition` (below) rather than hand-written per card.

### `ITriggerCondition`

Reusable, composable predicates that answer one question: **"should this trigger fire?"** They are separated from `ITrigger` so the common firing filters are written once, tested once, and shared across every card. An `ITrigger.ShouldFire` implementation typically delegates to a single condition or a composed tree of them.

```csharp
interface ITriggerCondition {
    bool Matches(GameEvent evt, GameState state, string sourceId);
}
```

`sourceId` is the trigger's host entity — the hosting **minion, artifact, or sigil (in hand or inscribed)** the trigger belongs to (2026-06-13, #10b). Conditions evaluate the event *relative to* the host. **Friendly/enemy is LANE-based** — i.e. by `ownerId`, treating the three lanes (player 1's board, player 2's board, the neutral lane) as the three "sides," with `null == null` meaning "same side":

- **`friendly`** = same `ownerId` as the host. For a player-owned host this is its controller's board (Hearthstone-identical, since your board == minions you control); for a **neutral host (`ownerId == null`)** it is the **neutral lane** (the other `ownerId == null` minions). So a neutral minion's "friendly" effects target its lane-mates.
- **`enemy`** = an *opposing* side. For a player host: the **opponent's board only** — the neutral lane is **not** enemy (it stays the separate `AllNeutralMinions` category, per the selector trichotomy). For a **neutral host**: **both** players' boards (everything off its lane). Deliberate asymmetry — a player sees three categories (friendly / enemy / neutral), a neutral minion sees two (its lane / everyone else); from a neutral source `friendly ∪ enemy` = all minions, from a player source it does not (neutral is the third bucket).

Formally, for host `h` and the event's relevant entity `e`:

```
friendly(h, e)  ⟺  h.ownerId == e.ownerId          // null == null is true → neutral lane-mates are friendly
enemy(h, e)     ⟺  h.ownerId != e.ownerId  &&  e.ownerId != null
```

The `e.ownerId != null` clause is what makes a **neutral minion never anyone's *enemy***: for a player host it keeps neutral out of "enemy" (the separate third category); the asymmetry — a neutral host *does* see both boards as enemy — falls out because that clause passes whenever `e` is a player minion. `friendly` and `enemy` are mutually exclusive; exhaustive only from a neutral host (a player host has the neutral "neither" bucket). Heroes carry their player's id, so the same predicates classify friendly/enemy heroes; neutral has no hero.

Genuinely **controller/turn-context** conditions are a *different* axis and stay empty for a neutral host because it lacks the referent, not because of the friendly relation: Start/End-of-Turn (no turn of its own — §3 `IEventBus`), OnArtifactActivated (no artifact row of its own), Combo (no hand / turn play-count).

**Single conditions — parameterless singletons** (referenced by reference; no per-check allocation):

| Condition | Matches when |
|---|---|
| `AlwaysFires` | always |
| `SelfIsSource` | the event's acting/source entity is `sourceId` |
| `SelfIsTarget` | the event's target entity is `sourceId` |
| `SelfIsRelated` | the event's primary subject (e.g. the dying minion in `MinionDiedEvent`) is `sourceId` |
| `FriendlyOnly` | the event's relevant entity is on the **same side** as `sourceId` (same `ownerId`, `null == null`) — for a neutral host, the neutral lane (see "friendly/enemy is lane-based" above) |
| `EnemyOnly` | the event's relevant entity is on an **opposing side** — for a player host, the opponent's board (not neutral); for a neutral host, either player's board |

**Single conditions — parameterized factories:**

| Condition | Matches when |
|---|---|
| `MinionTypeIs(definitionKey)` | the event's relevant minion has that `definitionKey` — a *specific* minion definition. (For tribal matching — "any Beast" — use `HasTribe`, below.) |
| `HasTribe(Tribe)` | the event's relevant minion's **`effectiveTribes`** (intrinsic \| granted \| aura — §1 Tribes) intersects the given flags — e.g. "whenever a **Beast** dies". The condition-side dual of the `MinionsWithTribe(Tribe)` selector factory; reads the effective view, so aura-granted tribes match while the aura holds. *(Added 2026-06-11 — closed a gap left when Item 8 landed tribes: the selector side got `MinionsWithTribe`, the condition side got nothing.)* |
| `CardTypeIs(CardType)` | the event's relevant card is a Minion / Spell / Artifact — e.g. "whenever you play a Spell **or** an Artifact" |
| `CostAtLeast(n)` / `CostAtMost(n)` | the event's relevant card's `effectiveCost` meets the threshold — e.g. "whenever you cast a 2-mana-or-higher spell" |

**Combinators** compose conditions into a tree:

| Combinator | Matches when |
|---|---|
| `All(c1, c2, …)` (AND) | every child matches; `All()` with no children matches |
| `Any(c1, c2, …)` (OR) | at least one child matches; `Any()` with no children does not match |

Combinators nest. Example — *"whenever a friendly Murloc or Beast dies"*:
`All(FriendlyOnly, HasTribe(Tribe.Murloc | Tribe.Beast))` — the `[Flags]` intersection makes the `Any` unnecessary for tribes (one flag test); `Any` remains for heterogeneous alternatives, e.g. `Any(HasTribe(Tribe.Beast), MinionTypeIs("patient_zero"))`.

(`Not(c)` is the obvious third combinator — same shape — needed the first time a card reads "any *other* friendly minion died" = `All(FriendlyOnly, Not(SelfIsRelated))`. Left out of v1 until a card requires it.)

**One card, many triggers.** A card's `definition` carries a `triggers` array; `DefaultCardHandler` registers each entry as its own `ITrigger` subscription, all active simultaneously for the host's lifetime. The condition library applies *per trigger*. These are two orthogonal axes: **combinators compose conditions *within* a single trigger; separate effects that watch different events are separate triggers.** Example — a minion reading *"Whenever you play a 2-mana-or-higher spell, summon a Beast. Whenever a Beast dies, draw a card."* registers two triggers:

```jsonc
"triggers": [
  { "type": "OnSpellCast",
    "condition": { "all": ["FriendlyOnly", { "costAtLeast": 2 }] },
    "effect": { "summon": "beast_token" } },
  { "type": "OnFriendlyMinionDeath",
    "condition": { "minionType": "beast" },
    "effect": { "draw": 1 } }
]
```

**Conditions gate; trigger type routes.** `ITriggerCondition` answers only *whether* a trigger fires. *When and in what order* it resolves is governed by the trigger's `TriggerType`, not its condition — and several types carry engine-defined resolution semantics the condition layer does not touch:

- **Battlecry** resolves synchronously inside the PlayCard pipeline (may pause for targeting via `PendingChoice`), *before* the minion's persistent triggers go live.
- **Deathrattle** resolves in death-wave **Phase 2** (§4 ⑦), in active-player-L→R order, off the minion's death snapshot — *not* at `MinionDiedEvent` publish time. (Contrast `OnFriendlyMinionDeath`, a generic reactive trigger that *does* fire at publish time. Same event, different condition: Deathrattle = `SelfIsRelated`, OnFriendlyMinionDeath = `FriendlyOnly` excluding self.)

So Battlecry and Deathrattle use the same `{ type, condition, effect }` shape and the same condition library (a conditional Battlecry like "if you're holding a Dragon" is just a custom or parameterized condition), but their timing/ordering remains defined by §4. Conditions cover the common gates; bespoke predicates that inspect arbitrary game state still implement `ITriggerCondition` directly.

**JSON encoding** of the condition tree (the `{ "all": [...] }` / `{ "minionType": "…" }` shapes above) is a `DefaultCardHandler` implementation detail, *not* part of this spec — it settles when the first compound card is authored.

### `ITargetSelector`

The **dual of `ITriggerCondition`**: a condition filters *events*, a selector produces *entities*. It is the single targeting primitive — one library answers "which entities does this effect act on?", "which targets may the player legally pick?", and "what are the options in a Discover/mid-effect choice?" There is no separate target-requirement taxonomy; legality is membership in a selector's output (below).

```csharp
interface ITargetSelector {
    EntityId[] Select(EffectContext context);  // pure; ordered; 0..N entities
}
```

`Select` is a **pure function of `GameState`** (read via the context) — no mutation, no RNG, no enqueueing. Like the condition library it evaluates *relative to* the source, using the **same lane-based friendly/enemy predicates** (§3 `ITriggerCondition`): `AllFriendlyMinions` = minions sharing the source's `ownerId` (a neutral source's friendlies are the neutral lane); `AllEnemyMinions` = minions on an opposing side (`src.ownerId != m.ownerId && m.ownerId != null` — so a player source's enemy set excludes the neutral lane, which is the separate `AllNeutralMinions`; a neutral source's enemy set is both boards). `Self`, `FriendlyHero`, `EnemyHero` classify by the same rule (neutral has no hero).

**Singletons — parameterless** (referenced by reference, no per-call allocation): `AllEnemyMinions`, `AllFriendlyMinions`, `AllNeutralMinions`, `AllMinions`, `AliveEnemyMinions`, `AliveFriendlyMinions`, `AliveNeutralMinions`, `AliveMinions`, `DeadEnemyMinions`, `DeadFriendlyMinions`, `DeadNeutralMinions`, `DeadMinions`, `EnemyHero`, `FriendlyHero`, `AllEnemyCharacters`, `AllFriendlyCharacters`, `Self`.

**Factories — parameterized:** `AdjacentTo(id)`, `MinionsWithTribe(Tribe)`, `MinionsWithKeyword(string)`, `OtherThan(selector, id)`, `Union(s1, s2, …)`, `Filter(selector, ITriggerCondition)` (reuse the condition library as the entity predicate — e.g. *"all damaged friendly minions"* = `Filter(AllFriendlyMinions, IsDamaged)`).

**Control / command targeting needs no new selectors.** A "take control of any neutral or enemy minion" card declares `Union(AllNeutralMinions, AllEnemyMinions)`; a neutral-only or enemy-only variant uses the corresponding singleton; "command a neutral to attack another neutral" uses `OtherThan(AllNeutralMinions, attackerId)`, and "command into the opponent lane" uses `Union(AllEnemyMinions, EnemyHero)`. Per-lane Taunt is **not** encoded in these selectors — it is enforced uniformly by the §4 ③ validator on top of the card's declared set, exactly as for a normal `AttackAction`.

**`All…` / `Alive…` / `Dead…` (mortally-wounded inclusion).** A minion at `currentHealth ≤ 0` that is **still on the board** — not yet removed by death resolution — is **"mortally wounded"** (a.k.a. pending death). (This window is transient under any model but becomes a designer-meaningful state under the cascade-settle death model — Fireplace amendment B, §4 ⑦ — where such a minion can persist across same-cascade reactions.) The three on-board minion families partition exactly on this distinction — **`All… = Alive… ∪ Dead…`**, disjoint:

| Family | Returns | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `AllEnemyMinions` / `AllFriendlyMinions` / `AllNeutralMinions` / `AllMinions` | **every on-board minion** of that side, **mortally-wounded included** | the effect should treat the doomed-but-present body as real — HS-faithful AoE and board-count effects ("deal 1 to all enemies", "damage equal to enemy minions") |
| `AliveEnemyMinions` / `AliveFriendlyMinions` / `AliveNeutralMinions` / `AliveMinions` | only minions with **`currentHealth > 0`** | the effect must **not** act on a corpse-in-waiting — e.g. "return a random alive enemy minion to hand", "buff your lowest-health alive minion" |
| `DeadEnemyMinions` / `DeadFriendlyMinions` / `DeadNeutralMinions` / `DeadMinions` | only the **mortally-wounded** (`currentHealth ≤ 0`, still on board, pending removal) | the effect targets the dying specifically — a **save-from-lethal** intervention or finisher, responding to lethal damage to rescue (or pick off) a dying minion (the "R1" avenue, amendment B), "destroy all mortally-wounded enemies", counting the doomed |

Each `Alive…` singleton is exactly `Filter(<corresponding All…>, currentHealth > 0)` and each `Dead…` is `Filter(<corresponding All…>, currentHealth ≤ 0)`, surfaced as named singletons for ergonomics. **The predicates are health-only, deliberately (2026-06-12):** a destroy-marked minion at positive health sits in `Alive…`, not `Dead…` — correct on both ends, since `Dead…` is the *save-targeting* family and marked minions are unsavable (§2A `DestroyMinionAction`), while for everything else (AoE, counts, retaliation) a marked minion behaves as the living board presence it still is. **Heroes have no mortally-wounded state** — a 0-health hero ends the game at §4 ⑧ rather than lingering — so there is no `Alive`/`Dead` hero/character variant. **Graveyard minions are *not* covered here:** an already-removed minion (resurrection / "died this turn" pools) is not a board target — selecting from the graveyard to *summon* is a separate primitive, not an `ITargetSelector`.

**Ordering.** The returned list is **ordered by the canonical board order** (Deterministic Ordering) shared with trigger fire order and death/deathrattle sort: current player `board[0..n]` → opponent `board[0..n]` → neutral zone by index, with heroes slotted by the selector's own definition. Ordered, not unordered, because sequential within-action application (per-target damage, `DamageTakenEvent` emission order, keyword pulls) is order-sensitive and determinism demands a fixed order. (Deaths are no longer interleaved per hit — they settle at ⑦, amendment B — but the per-target application order still must be fixed.) Selectors never invent a second ordering.

**Three consumption modes** — a selector's candidate set covers every targeting feature with no new mechanism:

| Mode | How the effect consumes `Select(context)` |
|---|---|
| **Auto-hit** (AoE) | Enqueue **one** action carrying the **`ITargetSelector` reference** (the same one-action-carries-selector pattern as Random-K below); the stage-④ handler evaluates it over the current board and applies the effect to every result, in returned order — e.g. Flamestrike is a *single* `DealDamageAction` carrying `AllEnemyMinions`. Pure: no RNG. **One action ⇒ one ③′ declaration ⇒ one interception/pre-damage window** for the whole AoE (with the targets as that window's selector), rather than N per-entity actions raising N windows (see §3 "Reactive…", "Batching"). The handler still emits one per-target event (e.g. a `DamageTakenEvent` each). |
| **Random-K** | Enqueue **one** action carrying the **`ITargetSelector` reference** (not a pre-computed pool) + `k`; the **stage-④ handler evaluates the selector against the *current* board, then draws K** using that action's epoch-derived `IRandom`. Carrying the selector rather than a frozen `EntityId[]` keeps selection both pure *and* current — if a candidate is mortally wounded or removed between enqueue and the draw, the ④ evaluation reflects it (and the card chooses the right `All…/Alive…/Dead…` family to decide whether the dying still count). Randomness is consumed only at ④, preserving the Item-6 invariant verbatim and keeping each draw attributable to one action's epoch (clean for the `StabilizationAbortReport`). |
| **Player-choice** (Discover, mid-effect targeting) | Issue `StartChoiceAction` with `options =` the candidate set → existing `PendingChoice` (§4). The selector *feeds* the choice; it does not subsume it — "compute targets" and "interrupt for player input" stay separate concerns. |

**Player-target legality is unified into the same primitive.** A card/effect requiring a player-supplied target declares a `(selector, cardinality)` pair. The §4 ③ validator's *"is a legal target type for this card"* check is then exactly: **`chosen ∈ selector.Select(context)`** (plus the cardinality/optionality rule) → `InvalidTarget` otherwise. The *same* `AllEnemyMinions` selector that an AoE uses to hit every enemy is what a single-target spell uses to define its legal targets — so previewed legality (client highlighting), validation, and effect resolution can never disagree. This replaces the spec's earlier hand-wave with one source of truth (parallel to how §4 ③ made the validator the single source of truth for action legality).

**JSON encoding** of selector references in card definitions is a `DefaultCardHandler` detail, *not* part of this spec — same treatment as the condition tree.

### Reactive Triggers, Interventions & Interception

This subsection unifies the **sigil** family (reactive cards — both deployments, invoked and inscribed; see "Sigils" below), the locked Intervention system, and the dying-window — the **save-from-lethal** beat, where a player responds to lethal damage to rescue a minion before it dies (the "R1" avenue in amendment B) — into **one** mechanism over `ITrigger`. Decided 2026-06-04 (Fireplace menu point D — the secrets/armed-reactive question); the armed flavour landed 2026-06-11 as the sigil model. Three ideas: **zone-scoped hosting**, **two hook phases**, and **interception as ordinary effects + re-resolution**.

**1 — A trigger is live by virtue of its host's zone (aura-like).** An `ITrigger` is registered by `ICardHandler` when its host enters a zone and unregistered when it leaves — exactly as a board minion's triggers register in `OnSummon` and drop on death. The same lifecycle simply runs on **other zones**:

| Host zone | Registered on | What a fired trigger does | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **board** (minion) | `OnSummon` (entering board) | ordinary reaction | existing |
| **hand** (sigil) | the `DrawCard`/`GiveCard` handler (entering hand), dropped on play/discard/return | opens a **set-valued, looping intervention** window for the owner (play one / skip; re-opens on each play) — playing one is an **invocation** | **this amendment** |
| **inscriptions** (sigil) | the `PlayCardAction` inscribe branch (entering the zone), dropped on reveal | **auto-resolves** without a prompt (an **inscription**); player choices in the response degrade to **random** (see "Sigils") | **resolved 2026-06-11** (the sigil model) |
| **artifact row** (`ArtifactOnBoard`) | the `EquipArtifactAction` handler (entering the row), dropped on destroy/discard | **auto-resolves** (board-side zone — a passive artifact's triggers, and any `IAura` it hosts, behave exactly like a minion's; no player window). A trigger-fire consumes `durability` iff the definition declares trigger-fire a consumer | **added 2026-06-11** (artifacts) |

All of this obeys the existing invariants unchanged: registration happens inside an action handler (④), so every reactive trigger has a `birthEpoch` and the creation-epoch filter (§3 `IEventBus`) stops a freshly-drawn card from reacting to the very event that drew it; the bus still carries only `ITrigger`. The hand is "armed" simply by holding the card — there is no separate arming step, and **what opens a window is precise and inspectable**: a card in hand whose live reactive trigger matched. This realises the locked Intervention scope ("play one card / skip") literally — the window only ever offers a card *designed* with a reactive trigger.

**2 — Two hook phases; that is the whole taxonomy.** Every action has a **pre** phase and **post** events:

- **Pre — the declaration phase (`ActionDeclaredEvent`, stage ③′).** A trigger here fires *before* the action resolves and may **intercept** it (prevent / alter). This is the held-action / suspend-resume kind. It fires **immediately, per action, mid-cascade** — there is no other coherent timing, since interception must precede that action's ④. A response does not end the matter: if it **plays** a card, the held action re-validates (②③) and — if still legal — **re-declares (③′)**, re-opening the window over the responder's *remaining* matching + affordable cards; the loop runs until the responder **skips** (the held action proceeds to ④) or holds nothing affordable, or the action **fizzles** (the **re-declare loop**, 2026-06-09). Multiple held interventions on one declaration are thus the responder chaining their *own* cards, in an order they set by which they pick each pass — **not** a nested stack (depth-1 still bars a further *player window* on a response; an auto host — inscription or artifact — may still fire — and even intercept — inline; see §4 ③′).
- **Post — the regular events.** A trigger here reacts *after* the fact and cannot prevent — it just acts. This **includes `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent` / `HeroMortallyWoundedEvent`**: a "save" reaction on those is an ordinary post-reaction whose *before-finalization* timing is a gift of the cadence deferral (⑦ death / ⑧ win are settle stages — §4), **not** special machinery. "Consequence-deferral" is therefore not a third category; it is a post-reaction that exploits the deferral. **Post-reaction player windows are set-valued and re-offer on play (stage ⑥′)**: after a *single* action's ⑤/⑥, the engine opens **one** window presenting *all* the responder's matching + affordable hand cards; the player plays **one** (choosing it and its targets) or **skips**. A played card's targets come from its *own* matched-subject set, so an AoE (one selector-carrying action hitting N minions) offers that one card over all N subjects — **one** window, not N. Each **play** re-offers the *remaining* matching set against the same (frozen) events (the **re-offer loop**, 2026-06-09); a **skip** ends the window (only a play changes the offer). Two *separate* damage actions remain two distinct instances → two windows. The triggering unit is one action's events — **never per-event, never per-cascade** (see §4 "Batching"). Deterministic, no-choice reactions belong on auto hosts (an inscription, or a board/artifact trigger) and open no window at all.

**3 — Interception is ordinary effects + re-resolution — there is no "disposition vocabulary."** An interception response runs as **normal effects** (summon, grant a keyword, gain armor, return-to-hand, deal damage — anything a card can do). The held action is then **re-resolved through full validation (②③)**, so almost every "alteration" emerges for free:

- grant Divine Shield to the defender → on resume the shield (a keyword pull at the damage moment) absorbs the hit;
- grant Poisonous to the defender → its resumed counter-damage destroys the attacker;
- gain armor / a standing damage modifier → read at the damage moment, no action edit (`PlayerState.armor`, §1; consumed at the ④ hero absorb slot);
- destroy / return / silence the attacker, or summon a **Taunt** token → on resume the held action **re-validates and either fizzles or is forced to the Taunt** by the ordinary rules.

Only **two** manipulations cannot be expressed as board-state mutation, and they are the *entire* irreducible surface — not a vocabulary:

- **cancel** — drop the held action (Counterspell: nothing on the board invalidates a legally-cast spell);
- **retarget** — substitute the held action's target *in place*, without re-declaring it (Misdirection's random redirect, Spellbender's spell redirect — not derivable from Taunt).

**Completeness rests on one invariant:** *anything a card can intercept is a discrete action* (so it has a declaration phase). Intrinsic, deterministic modifiers (the Divine Shield keyword, armor) are **pulled inline at resolution**, never declared — consistent with the `IKeyword` pull model (§3 `IKeyword`). So one interception point has **two realisations**: intrinsic *pulls* (hot-path, no window) and extrinsic *subscriptions* (sigils — inscribed or held, possibly windowed).

**This subsumes damage prevention (menu point A — now closed).** Ice-Block-style "prevent the fatal hit, no side-effects" is an **interception on `DealDamageAction`** (`cancel`, or grant the target immunity, at its declaration) — *not* a `HeroMortallyWoundedEvent` post-reaction, which would let the damage (and its lifesteal/reflect side-effects) register before undoing the death. Three things make this universal and deterministic:

- **All damage flows through `DealDamageAction`, combat included.** `AttackAction` *enqueues* `DealDamageAction`s for the two combatants rather than applying damage inline, so the predamage declaration covers **every** source — Ice Block / redirect / prevention stops combat damage too, not just spells. **Combat is two independent damage actions, not one atomic unit (decided 2026-06-06).** The attacker's strike and the defender's retaliation are each first-class actions — each with its own ③′ declaration and its own ⑥′ window — processed **strictly sequentially** through the queue. This is the §4 ⑥′ rule applied verbatim ("one window per action; two instances = two windows"); an atomic single-window combat would be an *exception* to that rule, so it was rejected. Consequences: **(a)** interception/reaction windows are **per recipient** — the natural granularity, since Ice Block / Divine Shield protect one entity, not "a combat" — and a held card may interleave **between** the two hits (e.g. bounce the defender to dodge its retaliation); **(b)** a same-combat reaction sees **per-hit** board state (the defender's "when damaged" reaction fires *before* the retaliation lands) — a deliberate, narrow divergence from HS's apply-both-then-react; **(c)** **base attack is snapshotted at `AttackAction` ④** (HS-style attack lock), while damage *modifiers* are pulled at each damage action's ④ (precedence below). Because death is deferred to ⑦, **both combatants are mortally-wounded-but-on-board until the queue drains, so they die in one shared wave**, and a lethal-but-not-removed defender **still deals its retaliation with full effect** (keywords + source-side modifiers pulled live). This makes **dying-swing retaliation** — Poisonous/Lifesteal on a dying defender, or "retaliation doubled while mortally wounded" — a supported mechanic *by construction*, not special machinery.
- **AoE damage is one declaration.** An auto-hit AoE is a *single* selector-carrying `DealDamageAction` (§3 `ITargetSelector`), so it raises **one** ③′ window with the targets as its selector — the pre-damage twin of post-reaction batching (one window for 7 minions), differing only in that it fires **immediately, before the hits** (pre-damage cannot defer to the settle). Per-target protection inside it is a grant (immune / Divine Shield) read at ④, not a new op.
- **④ damage-modifier precedence (pinned).** After ③′ interception, the handler computes each target's effective amount in a fixed order: **(1)** base `amount` (spell-damage bonus already baked at enqueue, §3 `IEffect`); **(2)** multiplicative modifiers (double-damage); **(3)** flat reductions, floored at 0; **(4)** caps; **(5)** **immune** → 0, stop (no shield break, no armor loss, no health loss); **(6)** the **absorb slot, by target type** — *minion*: **Divine Shield** → if still > 0, break it (`DivineShieldBrokenEvent`) and set 0; *hero*: **armor** → `absorbed = min(armor, amount)`, `armor −= absorbed`, `amount −= absorbed` (reported as `DamageTakenEvent.armorAbsorbed`, §2B — partial absorption lets the remainder through, unlike the all-or-nothing Shield); **(7)** apply the remainder to `currentHealth`/`health`, compute overkill, emit `DamageTakenEvent`, and if `≤ 0` emit `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent` (hero → `HeroMortallyWoundedEvent`). Only the baked spell-damage bonus (1) and the absorb slot / events (6–7) exist in v1; steps 2–4 are the slots future modifiers drop into, in this order, so stacking stays deterministic and replayable.

**Visibility — the responder's side (pinned 2026-06-10; queued topic #4).** One **information ceiling**: a window prompt never widens the responder's visibility — it shows exactly **their own candidates** (their hand, plus engine-computed legal targets per card — §1 `InterventionCandidate`) **+ the cause**, where the cause is either public-by-nature or already on their wire:

- **③′:** the **held action verbatim** — its full §2A params (`PlayCardAction: Fireball → your m3`). Prior art is **unanimous** (MTG stack objects, YGO chain links, LoR stack-with-targets, FaB attacks): every game with a responder window shows the pending object in full — informed response *is* the point of a player-choice window. Safe by construction: declared params are pre-resolution facts (randomness/draws resolve at ④), and casting = the moment of public reveal. One carve-out: a `PlayCardAction` that **inscribes a sigil** declares **redacted** — "inscribes a sigil" + the mana spent, never the card identity ("Sigils" below). This is the survey's one *sanctioned* hidden-identity case: face-down pre-armed cards protect **their owner's** card, never the actor's pending action.
- **⑥′:** **refs to the matched events** (`causeEventIds[]` — they were published at ⑤ and are already on the responder's wire before the window opens); the prompt re-embeds nothing, so it can never out-reveal the wire (a trigger matching the opponent's `CardDrawnEvent` does not expose the drawn card).
- **Windows stay contingent** (they open only when candidates exist) with a **thin public event** alongside the responder-directed prompt (§2B): the acting player learns *a* matching reactive card exists — the Arena/Master-Duel tell, accepted deliberately over LoR-style structural windows (which would pause every action all game). Masking the tell is a server/UX option, not engine machinery.

### Sigils — one reactive card, two deployments (2026-06-11)

A **sigil** is a card whose definition carries a reactive `ITrigger` (v1 content: spell-typed; the hosting seam is type-agnostic, so ambush-style sigil minions remain possible). There is **no secret card kind**: every sigil supports **both** deployments, and the host zone — already the behavioral discriminator in the hosting table above — *is* the mode selector:

- **Invocation** — hold the sigil in hand; when its trigger matches inside a window, the owner may play it via `SubmitInterventionAction` (full choice: see the cause, pick targets, or decline). Pays from the carried off-turn pool at response time.
- **Inscription** — pre-commit it face-down via `PlayCardAction` on one's own turn (pay-on-inscribe; the trigger fires free later). It **auto-resolves on the first matching event** — no prompt, no decline.

The two modes differ on exactly three axes, all zone-derived: **choice** (window has it; inscription doesn't), **depth** (player windows are depth-1-capped; inscriptions fire inline even on a response's sub-actions), and **economy** (invoke pays later from the carried pool and costs a hand slot; inscribe pays now from the on-turn pool, frees the hand, and shows a face-down tell).

**Rules of the inscribed mode:**

- **Choice degradation → random.** An inscribed sigil's response resolves every player decision at random via `IRandom` (counter-reseeded — deterministic, replay-safe): a declared `(selector, cardinality)` target requirement consumes as **random-K drawn at ④** (the existing `ITargetSelector` consumption mode) instead of player-choice; modal choices pick uniformly. Same selector, same cardinality — the mode flips, the card doesn't. Every sigil is therefore inscribable, even ones players would rarely inscribe.
- **Actor-attribution firing rule** (replaces any turn-based rule): an inscription **never fires on events caused by its own owner's action** — skip iff the causing action is attributed to the host's owner (player actions → the submitter; effect actions → the controller of the attributed source, §3 "Source Attribution"; neutral-sourced actions are attributed to no one and can spring **both** players' inscriptions). On an ordinary turn this is indistinguishable from HS's "opponent's turn only" — but it correctly lets *my* inscription punish an opponent's **invocation during my turn** (windows never change `TurnState.activePlayerId`; a window is a suspension inside the actor's turn), and a player's own deathrattles resolving off-turn never spring their own inscriptions.
- **Constraints:** cap `GameConstants.MaxInscriptions = 3`; **one inscription per `definitionKey`** (`SigilAlreadyInscribed`); full row rejects at ③ (`InscriptionSlotsFull`). An inscribed copy and a held copy of the same sigil are **independent** — the inscription auto-fires in dispatch order, and the held copy is still offered in the subsequent window (each mode follows its own rule).
- **One-shot:** firing consumes the inscription — reveal (`SigilRevealedEvent`), resolve, then `inscriptions` → graveyard. Persistent standing triggers are what **passive artifacts** are for; the two stay distinct.
- **Empty-pool guard:** an inscription does **not** fire if a required selector pool is empty at fire time — it stays inscribed, unconsumed (HS-faithful "won't trigger if it would do nothing"; fire-and-fizzle-and-consume is a pure feel-bad).
- **Dispatch slot:** inscription-hosted triggers fire **inside their owner's dispatch group, after that owner's artifacts**, in inscription order (`inscriptions[0..2]`) — the artifact precedent extended one slot (§3 `IEventBus`). Auto-chains (my inscription's response springing theirs, springing mine…) need no depth rule: each fire consumes its card and the rows cap at 3, so chains terminate structurally.
- **Visibility:** existence public, identity hidden — inscribing emits the owner-directed `SigilInscribedEvent` + public thin `InscriptionAddedEvent` *instead of* `CardPlayedEvent` (§2B); full public reveal only at fire time. The armed-state telegraph question is thereby resolved: the zone shows N face-down cards, HS-style (full hiding is unachievable anyway — the mana delta is public). Hand-held sigils need no telegraph rule: they are ordinary hidden hand cards, and the contingent-window tell is already accepted.

*(Engine identifiers keep the `Intervention*` names for the window machinery — `PendingIntervention`, `SubmitInterventionAction`, `InterventionPromptEvent`; sigil / invoke / inscribe is the game vocabulary for the card family, the acts, and the zone, layered on those primitives.)*

**Nothing remains deferred in this subsection.** *(History: the secret bundle — auto flavour, zone, constraints, telegraph, cost timing, identity — resolved 2026-06-11 as the sigil model above; the **marked-for-destruction scope** resolved 2026-06-12, option A — fiat dooms are unsavable and silent, preventable only at the destroy action's ③′ declaration (§2A `DestroyMinionAction`, §2B `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent`); batching: §4 "Batching".)* See the borrow-list note.

### `IAura`

Continuous effects recalculated after every board-affecting action. Aura bonuses are **never** stored in `enchantments` — they live in `auraAttackBonus`/`auraHealthBonus` and are fully rewritten on every recalculation pass. An aura is registered when its host **enters its zone** — a minion at summon (`OnSummon`, ④), a passive artifact at equip (`EquipArtifactAction` ④) — and dropped when the host leaves; `SourceEntityId` names that host (minion or artifact).

```csharp
interface IAura {
    string AuraId { get; }
    string SourceEntityId { get; }   // the hosting entity — a minion OR a passive artifact (§1 ArtifactOnBoard). Renamed from SourceMinionId (2026-06-13, #9): artifacts host auras now, and they implement this literal contract.
    IEnumerable<AuraEffect> Calculate(GameState state);
}

record AuraEffect(
    string TargetMinionId,
    int AttackBonus,
    int HealthBonus,
    Tribe GrantedTribes = Tribe.None,
    IReadOnlyList<string>? GrantedKeywords = null);  // any keyword — pulled from the effective view, never a bus subscription (§3 IKeyword); see below
```

A minion that reaches ≤0 `maxHealth` due to an aura loss is treated identically to a minion killed by damage.

Aura-granted tribes and keywords flow through `AuraEffect.GrantedTribes` / `GrantedKeywords`: each recalc pass, a minion's `auraTribes` is rewritten to the OR of all `GrantedTribes` targeting it, and its `auraKeywords` to the union of all `GrantedKeywords` targeting it (parallel to `auraAttackBonus`/`auraHealthBonus`) — so both appear/disappear with the aura and never persist.

**Aura recalc only rewrites lists; it never touches the bus.** Keywords are declarative markers pulled from the effective view at the minion's own action moments (§3 `IKeyword`) — no keyword subscribes to the bus — so an aura may grant **any** keyword, with no registration-during-recalc problem, and the grant disappears when the aura leaves. (Keyword-model collapse, 2026-06-02: the earlier active/declarative split — and its restriction that an *active* keyword could not be aura-granted because it would have to subscribe during stage ⑥ — was removed; see §3 `IKeyword` and the removal note under "Unaddressed Features".)

**Aura scope & the neutral lane.** An aura's reach is entirely its `Calculate` — there is **no hardcoded neutral wall**; scope is the same lane-based friendly/enemy + selector semantics used everywhere (§3 `ITriggerCondition`/`ITargetSelector`). Consequences, all derived (no new machinery — recalc already zeroes/rewrites the `aura*` fields on **every** minion including the neutral lane, §4 ⑥): a **player's** friendly-scoped aura ("your other minions +1/+1") excludes the neutral lane (a player's `friendly` is its own board); a **neutral** minion's friendly-scoped aura buffs its **lane-mates** (its `friendly` is the neutral lane); reaching the lane from a player aura requires an explicit `AllNeutralMinions`/`AllMinions` selector in `Calculate`; **adjacency** auras (`AdjacentTo`) are per-lane, since each side is its own ordered array with no cross-lane adjacency.

### `ICardHandler`

Top-level extensibility point. Cards with non-trivial behaviour have a `handlerKey` in their definition that maps to an `ICardHandler` implementation. Cards without custom logic use `DefaultCardHandler`, which reads the `definition` JSON and dispatches to standard `IEffect` implementations.

```csharp
interface ICardHandler {
    string HandlerKey { get; }
    void OnPlay(CardPlayContext context, IEventBus bus, IActionQueue queue);
    void OnSummon(MinionOnBoard minion, IEventBus bus, IActionQueue queue);
    void OnDeath(MinionOnBoard minion, IEventBus bus);
}
```

`OnDeath` is responsible for enqueuing this minion's Deathrattle actions only. Reborn is always handled by `DeathResolutionService` in Phase 3 — `ICardHandler.OnDeath` must not enqueue its own Reborn.

### `IRandom`

All in-match randomness flows through a single injected `IRandom`. No implementation may call `Random.Shared`, a clock-seeded RNG, or any other ambient source. This is the determinism contract that makes telemetry (`StabilizationAbortReport`, §4 ⑦) and replay possible.

```csharp
interface IRandom {
    int Next(int maxExclusive);                   // [0, maxExclusive)
    int Next(int minInclusive, int maxExclusive); // [minInclusive, maxExclusive)
}
```

**Seed.** `GameState.rngSeed: ulong` is fixed at match creation and never mutates. It is server-side state — the client is a pure event renderer and never receives `GameState`, so the seed is structurally hidden from both players and cannot be used to predict draws. Tests construct the engine with a chosen seed for repeatable scenarios.

**Per-action derivation (counter-based).** There is **no single long-lived PRNG** advanced across the match. Instead, at the start of each action's stage ④ the engine derives a *fresh* `IRandom` for that action from `mix(rngSeed, currentActionEpoch)` via a strong mixing function (e.g. splitmix64, so adjacent epochs yield uncorrelated streams). The handler draws from that instance as many times as it needs; draw order within the action is fixed by the deterministic pipeline ordering (below). Consequence: **any single action is independently reproducible from `(rngSeed, currentActionEpoch, preActionState)` alone** — no PRNG internal state is ever serialized. That is what makes `StabilizationAbortReport` self-contained (its `preActionState` snapshot already carries `currentActionEpoch`), and it reuses the very `currentActionEpoch` introduced for event visibility (§3 `IEventBus`). This is the counter-based / splittable-RNG model (cf. JAX key-split, NumPy `SeedSequence.spawn`, Slay the Spire's per-domain streams), chosen over a single advancing stream precisely so a mid-game slice can be reproduced without serializing RNG state.

**Where randomness is consumed.** Only inside action handlers (stage ④), the sole state-mutation point. An effect or trigger that needs a random outcome enqueues an action whose handler does the roll — e.g. `DiscardCardAction { cardId = null }` picks the discard via `IRandom`; Discover generates its options; a "random enemy minion" action resolves its target. (Target *selectors* are **pure and do not receive `IRandom`** — see §3 `ITargetSelector`. A random-target effect enqueues a single action carrying the selector's *pool*; the stage-④ handler draws K from it with that action's `IRandom`. So random target resolution is, like every other roll, a stage-④ concern.)

**Deck shuffle (at init).** The opening shuffle runs inside the engine at match setup as a Fisher-Yates over `IRandom`, seeded from the match seed like any other action. **Decklists are the stored input; the shuffled order regenerates from `rngSeed`.** The coin flip (first player) and opening-hand deal are seeded the same way.

**Replay.** The engine is a **deterministic function of `(rngSeed, ruleset version, decklists, ordered input log)`**. System actions, random rolls, and the entire event cascade regenerate; `currentActionEpoch` reconstructs itself by counting actions, so it need not be stored. (A mid-game *slice* repro such as the abort report does not replay from the start, so it relies on `currentActionEpoch` being carried in the captured `GameState`.) Four points make this precise:

- **An *input* is anything submitted via `Submit`** — not only deliberate player moves but also **timeout / forfeit / disconnect-injected actions** (auto-`EndTurn`, auto-skip, auto-resolve a `PendingChoice`). These are *external nondeterminism* — they depend on wall-clock time, not game state, so they are **not** regenerable and **must** appear in the input log like any other action. (The timer that injects them is a Game Server concern; GameLogic only requires that they enter through the same `Submit` seam and are logged.) "Player actions only" would be subtly wrong the first time a turn times out.
- **Single, total-order input stream** — one sequence per game, not per-player. The engine processes inputs in a single total order; per-player streams would reintroduce interleaving ambiguity.
- **Ruleset-version pinning** — a command-log replay re-runs engine logic + card `definition` JSON, so it is only valid against the **same engine + card-definition version** it was recorded under (the classic command-log-replay fragility across patches). The replay package carries a ruleset/content version stamp.
- **Command log vs. event log — two artifacts, two jobs.** The **command/input log is canonical**: compact, re-simulatable, the source of truth (but version-fragile per above). The **event log is the client wire format**, spectator/late-join stream, and version-robust archive: self-contained state deltas the client renders with **no game logic**, but *not* re-simulatable. (The event log is exactly the **handler-produced deltas**; transient bus signals — `ActionDeclaredEvent` — are excluded, as they carry no state change. See §2B "Bus ⊋ log".) The asymmetry: the **event log is derivable from the command log + seed, never the reverse** (events record outcomes, not the inputs/rolls that produced them) — so the command log is the richer artifact and the event log the safer/self-contained one.

### Debug Trace (`ITraceSink`)

A **third, purely diagnostic stream** alongside the two §3 `IRandom`-Replay artifacts (command log = canonical/re-simulatable; event log = client wire format): the debug trace has **no replay, persistence, or wire role**, is server-side only, and its shape may change freely between versions. Primary use: when a test fails, read the trace to step through what the engine actually did, action by action. Emitted only when a sink is attached (tests, local repro) — **zero overhead otherwise**.

```csharp
interface ITraceSink { void Record(TraceRecord r); }   // engine ctor takes ITraceSink? — null = no tracing
```

**Emission model.** The pipeline calls the sink from *inside* stages — necessarily so: a stage-③ rejection produces zero events by invariant (§2C), so no post-processor over the event stream could ever see it. **Diffs are computed by structural compare** of `GameState` before/after each action — the clone cost is paid only when a sink is attached, and compare-based diffing guarantees **no mutation can escape the trace unseen** (the property that matters when hunting a bug; an instrumented-setter approach can only miss writes). A `JsonLinesTraceSink(Stream)` ships as the default implementation: one compact JSON object per line (System.Text.Json — the stack the data model already commits to via `JsonElement`), written **append-as-it-happens** — a crash or hang mid-cascade leaves a valid, readable trace up to the failure point (precisely when the trace is wanted most). Pretty-printers and the eventual **visualizer are downstream consumers, out of library scope** (same ruling as the animation layer and bot scaffolding); the schema below is what makes them possible.

**Record vocabulary** (JSON discriminator `k`; one record per *thing that happened*, in engine order — quiet stages emit nothing, per the stages-when-they-act principle):

| `k` | When | Carries |
|---|---|---|
| `state` | Match start + each time a cascade fully settles to idle | Full `GameState` snapshot incl. ordered deck contents, plus `v` (trace format version), `sessionId`, `rngSeed`, `epoch`. **Elides `definition` bodies** — cards/minions carry `definitionKey` only (definitions are static content, reproducible from the library — the Fabrication-rule philosophy applied to the trace) |
| `action` | One processed action (per ④; carries its `epoch`) | The action's own §2A params, then **only-if-nonempty**: `events` (⑤ payloads inline), `diff`, `enqueued` (each entry tagged `src` = enqueuing entity, so deathrattle-vs-trigger attribution is legible). Aura recalc (⑥) needs no marker — it surfaces as `aura*`/`attack`/`maxHealth` diff entries |
| `reject` | ②/③ refusal | The submitted action + error code. Zero events/diff by invariant — the record proves the action was submitted and refused |
| `fizzle` | A held action **cancelled** at ③′ or **illegal on resume** (re-validation fails after a response) | The fizzled action + `reason` (`Canceled` \| `Illegal(code)`) + any `events` it emitted (a card play emits `CardPlayFizzledEvent`; a cancelled `DealDamageAction`/attack is eventless). Distinct from `reject` — that is the zero-event pre-④ refusal of a freshly *submitted* action; a fizzle is a *resumed* action that dropped (2026-06-13, #8/#34) |
| `window` | A `PendingIntervention` opens (③′ or ⑥′) | `at`, responder, candidates, held action if any. The *resolution* is **not** in this record — the later `SubmitInterventionAction` traces as its own `action` record (append-only, real-time order; the re-declare/re-offer loop traces naturally as alternating `window`/`action` records) |
| `choice` | A `PendingChoice` opens | Same logic; `SubmitChoiceAction` resolves it as its own `action` record |
| `settle` | Per death wave (⑦); ⑧ **only when it acts** (a hero ≤ 0) | ⑦: `wave`, `deaths[]`, events, diff (zone moves), enqueued deathrattles/reborns. ⑧: the win/draw/save outcome |

**Worked examples.** All three were audited across the three streams in-session (bus = log + declarations; log = pure state deltas; wire = log filtered by directedness) and replay-checked from both the command log and the event log.

**(1) Combat → strike → retaliation → death → deathrattle.** `m3` (3 health) attacks `m7` (4 health); `m3` dies to the retaliation (overkill 1) and its deathrattle enqueues a real `DealDamageAction` tagged `src: m3` (no `DeathrattleAction` type exists — a deathrattle *is* its effect's ordinary actions, plus `DeathrattleTriggeredEvent` in the settle record):

```json
{"k":"action","epoch":42,"action":{"type":"AttackAction","attacker":"m3","target":"m7"},"events":[{"type":"AttackPerformedEvent","attacker":"m3","target":"m7"}],"diff":{"m3.attacksUsedThisTurn":[0,1]},"enqueued":[{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m3","tgt":"m7","amount":2},{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m7","tgt":"m3","amount":4}]}
{"k":"action","epoch":43,"action":{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m3","tgt":"m7","amount":2},"events":[{"type":"DamageTakenEvent","tgt":"m7","amount":2,"armorAbsorbed":0,"overkill":0,"src":"m3"}],"diff":{"m7.currentHealth":[4,2]}}
{"k":"action","epoch":44,"action":{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m7","tgt":"m3","amount":4},"events":[{"type":"DamageTakenEvent","tgt":"m3","amount":4,"armorAbsorbed":0,"overkill":1,"src":"m7"},{"type":"MinionMortallyWoundedEvent","minion":"m3"}],"diff":{"m3.currentHealth":[3,-1]}}
{"k":"settle","wave":0,"deaths":["m3"],"events":[{"type":"MinionDiedEvent","minion":"m3"},{"type":"DeathrattleTriggeredEvent","minion":"m3"}],"diff":{"m3":["p1.board[0]","p1.graveyard"]},"enqueued":[{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m3","tgt":"p2","amount":1}]}
```

**(2) Fireball countered (the #34 commit/resolve split).** `PlayCardAction` commits at ④ (mana paid, card → graveyard, `CardPlayedEvent`) and enqueues `ResolveCardAction`; `p2`'s Counterspell intercepts the **resolution**'s ③′; the resolution **fizzles** with no refund (mana stays 0, Fireball stays in the graveyard):

```json
{"k":"action","epoch":50,"action":{"type":"PlayCardAction","player":"p1","card":"c12","target":"m7"},"events":[{"type":"ManaChangedEvent","player":"p1","delta":-4},{"type":"CardPlayedEvent","player":"p1","card":"c12","target":"m7"},{"type":"SpellCastEvent","player":"p1","card":"c12","target":"m7"}],"diff":{"p1.mana":[4,0],"c12":["p1.hand","p1.graveyard"]},"enqueued":[{"type":"ResolveCardAction","card":"c12","def":"fireball","player":"p1","target":"m7"}]}
{"k":"window","at":"③′","responder":"p2","held":{"type":"ResolveCardAction","card":"c12","def":"fireball","target":"m7"},"candidates":[{"card":"c20","targets":[]}]}
{"k":"action","epoch":51,"action":{"type":"SubmitInterventionAction","responder":"p2","card":"c20","targets":[]},"events":[{"type":"CardPlayedEvent","player":"p2","card":"c20"},{"type":"SpellCastEvent","player":"p2","card":"c20"}],"diff":{"p2.mana":[3,0]}}
{"k":"fizzle","action":{"type":"ResolveCardAction","card":"c12","def":"fireball","target":"m7"},"reason":"Canceled","events":[{"type":"CardPlayFizzledEvent","player":"p1","card":"c12"}]}
```

**(3) Intercepted deathrattle (the #18 enqueue-and-drain).** A settle wave enqueues a deathrattle's `DealDamageAction` (`src` = the dead `m3`), which drains through the **full pipeline** — so it reaches its own ③′, where `p2` cancels it; the damage **fizzles** eventlessly:

```json
{"k":"settle","wave":0,"deaths":["m3"],"events":[{"type":"MinionDiedEvent","minion":"m3"},{"type":"DeathrattleTriggeredEvent","minion":"m3"}],"diff":{"m3":["p1.board[0]","p1.graveyard"]},"enqueued":[{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m3","tgt":"p2","amount":3}]}
{"k":"window","at":"③′","responder":"p2","held":{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m3","tgt":"p2","amount":3},"candidates":[{"card":"c30","targets":[]}]}
{"k":"action","epoch":61,"action":{"type":"SubmitInterventionAction","responder":"p2","card":"c30","targets":[]},"events":[{"type":"CardPlayedEvent","player":"p2","card":"c30"}],"diff":{"p2.mana":[2,1]}}
{"k":"fizzle","action":{"type":"DealDamageAction","src":"m3","tgt":"p2","amount":3},"reason":"Canceled","events":[]}
```

**Conventions.**
- **Entity refs are bare ids** (`m3` minion, `c12` card, `a2` artifact, `p1`/`p2` the two players — a **hero is its player id**, no separate `h*` ref; §1 "Card and Minion Identity"); the id → `definitionKey`/name join lives in `state` records — every line stays short, and the visualizer/pretty-printer does the join.
- **Diff keys are dotted paths** (`m7.currentHealth`, `p1.mana`), values `[from, to]`. **Zone moves** use the entity id as key and zone paths as values (`"m3": ["p1.board[0]", "p1.graveyard"]`); board *reorders* trace the same way (index-to-index).
- Action/event payloads inline their §2 fields verbatim — the trace schema **defers to §2** rather than re-declaring shapes.
- **No `queueAfter`** — the remaining queue is derivable from `enqueued` + FIFO order; printing it per action is pure redundancy (a future verbose flag could add it if the queue *discipline itself* ever needs debugging).

JSON Lines keeps the artifact greppable and line-diffable (`grep MinionDiedEvent trace.jsonl`; diff two runs line-by-line; `jq` for ad-hoc queries), and the line-per-record framing means a 30-action cascade reads top-to-bottom as a ledger even raw. Relation to `StabilizationAbortReport` (§4 ⑦): the report's `cascadeTrace` is the event-only cousin captured unconditionally; reproducing the abort under an attached `ITraceSink` yields the strictly richer per-action view (diffs, rejections, enqueue attribution).

### Deterministic Ordering

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| **Canonical board order** (one rule, two consumers) | Active player's `board[0..n]` by index → **their `artifacts[0..2]` by slot → their `inscriptions[0..2]` by index** (trigger side only, 2026-06-11) → opponent's `board[0..n]` by index → **their `artifacts[0..2]` → their `inscriptions[0..2]`** → **neutral zone by index**. Used identically for **trigger fire order** (`IEventBus`, snapshot at *publish* time) and **death/deathrattle/reborn sort** (`DeathResolutionService`, snapshot at *collect* time — artifacts never appear there: they have no health and are not death-wave members). Board index primary; `summonOrder` is the disambiguation fallback. Heroes are not `board[]` members and enter sequencing only via `ITargetSelector` per its own definition. Neutral minions take part in board-wide *event* triggers (last) but **not** turn-scoped Start/End-of-Turn triggers (no turn of their own) — see §3 `IEventBus`. |
| Event visibility (new subscribers) | `IEventBus` — snapshot at publish + `birthEpoch < originEpoch` creation-epoch filter; a listener never receives events from the action that created it |
| Death wave phases | `DeathResolutionService` — Phase 1 (remove) → Phase 2 (deathrattles) → Phase 3 (reborns) |
| Deathrattle before Reborn | `DeathResolutionService` — Phase 3 runs only after all Phase 2 actions complete |
| New deaths during deathrattles | `DeathResolutionService` — deferred to next wave, not resolved mid-wave |
| Resolution cadence | `GameEngine` — one action at a time; ①–⑥ run per action, draining the queue; ⑦ death + ⑧ win fire **only when the queue empties** (cascade settled), then loop. Deaths are batched at the settle point, never mid-cascade — so triggered reactions resolve before removals (amendment B) |
| Interception (declaration window) | `GameEngine` — stage ③′: an action suspends before ④; the response resolves **immediately** and fully (board/auto triggers fire inline; the **depth-1 cap** bars only a further *player window* on a response — *nesting* — while auto hosts — inscriptions, board/artifact triggers — still fire, and may intercept, inline), then the held action re-validates and, if still legal, **re-declares (③′)** — re-opening the **set-valued** window over the responder's remaining matching+affordable cards until they **skip** or the action fizzles/executes. **Iteration** (one responder chaining their own cards on one action) is bounded by next-turn mana, not capped; **nesting** is capped at depth-1. The only deviation from FIFO (point D) |
| Post-reaction window | `GameEngine` — stage ⑥′: after each action's ⑤/⑥, **one set-valued window** offering all the responder's matching + affordable reactive hand cards; play one (card + targets from its matched set) or **skip**; a **play** re-offers the remaining set, a **skip** ends it. Response resolves immediately before the queue resumes; deaths **not** pre-settled. Per action — never per-event, never per-cascade |
| Randomness | `IRandom` — per-action stream derived from `mix(rngSeed, currentActionEpoch)`; consumed only in stage ④ handlers; draw order fixed by the rows above |

---

## Section 4: Action Processing Pipeline

The pipeline is a **loop**, not a single linear pass (cadence amended 2026-06-03 — Fireplace amendment B). Stages **①–⑥ run per action** as each is dequeued; triggered reactions enqueue further actions, and the engine keeps dequeuing and running ①–⑥ until the **action queue is empty** — the point at which the cascade started by a top-level action has fully *settled*. Only then do the **settle stages** run: **⑦ Death Resolution** and **⑧ Win Check**. **⑨** drives the loop (dequeue next, or trigger the settle when the queue is empty). The engine never advances a stage until the current one completes.

Because deaths are processed only at the settle point, **every triggered reaction from the settling cascade resolves *before* any minion is removed**: a minion reduced to ≤0 HP (or destroy-marked) is **pending death** — still on the board, still targetable and countable, still keyword-active — until the settle, not removed on the spot. (Terminology, 2026-06-12: "mortally wounded" names the *health-domain* kind, which fires `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent` and is savable; a destroy-mark shares only the lingering board presence — no event, no save; §1 `currentHealth` / §2A `DestroyMinionAction`.) This is the Hearthstone-faithful cadence; it replaced an earlier per-action model where ⑦ ran at the tail of *every* action (so a dying minion vanished before same-event reactions ran). See amendment B in the borrow-list note for the design rationale, the mechanics it unlocks (overkill, retaliation, simultaneous-death, count-the-doomed, Intervention × lethal), and the worked example.

When a debug trace sink is attached (§3 `ITraceSink`), the pipeline emits one trace record per processed action (④), rejection (②/③), window/choice opening (③′/⑥′), and death wave (⑦) — plus full-state snapshots at match start and each settle-to-idle. See §3 for the record vocabulary.

### ① Submit

Player action arrives via WebSocket, or system action is dequeued from `IActionQueue`. `Submit` returns a `SubmitResult` — `Accepted(events)` or `Rejected(ActionRejection)` (see §2C).

### ② Phase Guard

Rejects the action if it is not valid in the current `GamePhase`, returning `Rejected(WrongPhase)` with no state mutation (see §2C).

| Phase | Accepted actions |
|---|---|
| `WaitingForPlayers` | None — pre-game: awaiting both players' connections. **Match Setup** runs on the second connect, then → `Mulligan`. |
| `Mulligan` | `SubmitMulliganAction` only |
| `InProgress` | All player-initiated actions |
| `PendingChoice` | `SubmitChoiceAction` from the waiting player only |
| `PendingIntervention` | `SubmitInterventionAction` from the responding player only |
| `Ended` | None |

System actions bypass Phase Guard — they are trusted internal commands.

### ③ Action Validator

Precondition checks. Returns `Rejected(ActionRejection)` with the matching code and no state mutation on failure (codes per §2C):

- Turn ownership: is this the active player? → `NotActivePlayer`
- Mana affordability: `effectiveCost ≤ player.mana` → `NotEnoughMana`
- Target validity: target is not stealthed (for opponent spells/attacks) and is a **member of the card/effect's declared target selector's output** (`chosen ∈ selector.Select(context)`, plus the cardinality/optionality rule — see §3 `ITargetSelector`) → `InvalidTarget` / `TargetStealthed`. **Aliveness is *not* checked here** (2026-06-13): the policy lives entirely in the declared selector (`All…/Alive…/Dead…`), so a save-targeting `Dead…`/`All…` effect may legally target a mortally-wounded (≤0-health, still-on-board) minion — a flat "is alive" gate would contradict the `Dead…` family. (The *attacker*-aliveness check for `AttackAction` is separate — see "Attack eligibility" below.) The same selector defines the client's legal-target highlighting, so preview and validation cannot drift.
- Attacker control: the submitter may attack only with a minion **it controls** — `attacker.ownerId == submitter` → else `AttackerNotControlled`. This is an explicit check (it closes the gap where the old "is this the active player?" line let a player swing with an opponent-owned minion), and it means **neutrals are never default attackers** (`ownerId == null` controls for no one). The **sole exception** is `CommandAttackAction`, a card-granted effect whose validation permits a *neutral* `attackerId` (the relaxed attacker rule); it still runs every other check below.
- Taunt enforcement — **per lane** (amended 2026-06-07): the constraint is scoped to the **target's lane**. Attacking into the **opponent lane** → if that opponent has Taunt minions *on their own board*, the attack must target one (else `MustTargetTaunt`); face is legal when none. Attacking into the **neutral lane** → if a neutral Taunt is present, the attack must target it. **Cross-lane Taunt never applies** — a neutral Taunt does not lock you out of the opponent's hero, nor an opponent Taunt out of a neutral. (Supersedes the earlier "Taunt is ignored for neutral minions" scope; neutral Taunt is now honored, but only within the neutral lane.) The same rule governs `CommandAttackAction`.
- Attack eligibility: the attacker is **alive** — `currentHealth > 0` and not destroy-marked (else `AttackerNotAlive`) — not frozen (`isFrozen = false`, else `AttackerFrozen`), and has an activation left (`attacksUsedThisTurn < budget`, else `AttackerExhausted`, where the per-turn **budget** is *pulled* from effective keywords — Windfury → 2, else 1 — never a stored field, so silencing Windfury immediately drops the budget and a once-swung minion is correctly exhausted). **Summoning-sickness + haste is one *pulled*, target-aware check, not a stored verdict:** if the attacker is `summoningSick` (it entered a board this turn and has not woken at a controller turn-start — set on entry by **both** summon and control), the engine pulls its effective keywords —
  - **Charge** → may attack any legal target;
  - **Rush** → may attack a **minion only** (enemy or neutral; per-lane Taunt still applies), and a hero/face target is rejected `RushCannotTargetHero`;
  - **neither** → it cannot attack at all → `AttackerCannotAttack`.

  A non-sick attacker may hit any legal target. Pulling Charge/Rush here (rather than baking a `canAttack` bool at entry) is the §3 `IKeyword` philosophy: aura-granted haste works mid-turn and silenced haste is correctly lost, with no recompute — and the shared board-entry routine (summon **and** control) does nothing but set `summoningSick`, never a per-handler charge/rush rule. (Neutrals are never `summoningSick`; a `CommandAttackAction` bypasses this eligibility entirely, and retaliation is ungated — see the fizzle note next.)

  The aliveness check is what makes a **mortally-wounded attacker fizzle on re-validation**: a "destroy / return the attacker" interception (§3) leaves the attacker ≤0 / destroy-marked but on board (death is deferred to ⑦), and the held attack, re-entering ③ on resume, is rejected here before it can swing — and likewise the second strike of a **Windfury command** fizzles if the first retaliation mortally wounded the neutral. **This fizzle is the *attacker's* concern only — never the defender's retaliation.** Eligibility (③) gates the *active swing* of an `AttackAction` / `CommandAttackAction`; a defender's **retaliation** is a separate `DealDamageAction` whose source is the defender, and it is **not** subject to this check — so a **mortally-wounded defender still retaliates with full effect** (live keywords + stats, because death is deferred to ⑦). A minion killed-but-not-removed swings back; it just cannot *initiate* a fresh swing.
- Board space: player board has fewer than 7 minions before summoning → `BoardFull`

**Validation is a pure, standalone-invokable predicate.** Stages ② and ③ together form a side-effect-free function `(action, state) → Ok | Rejection` (where `Rejection` is the `ActionRejection` of §2C) — no mutation, no dispatch (④), no events. It is the **single source of truth for legality**: `Submit` runs it before ④, and any "is this action legal?" / "what actions are legal?" query — a future `GetLegalActions(playerId)`, bot move generation, or client pre-flight (greying out unaffordable cards / illegal targets) — **must call this same predicate** rather than re-deriving legality. This guarantees previewed/enumerated legality can never drift from what `Submit` actually accepts. (The positive-enumeration API itself — `GetLegalActions`, via brute-force-then-filter over candidate actions — is deferred to the future bot-support epic; only the standalone-predicate seam is part of the core.)

### ③′ Declaration & Interception Window

A pre-execution checkpoint inserted between validation (③) and dispatch (④) — it does **not** renumber ④–⑨. (Decided 2026-06-04, Fireplace point D; the model lives in §3 "Reactive Triggers, Interventions & Interception".) For every action that reaches dispatch:

1. Publish **`ActionDeclaredEvent { action }`** — the universal pre-execution signal (one event type for all actions; subscribers filter on the carried action's type/params). Most actions have no matching reactive trigger and pass straight to ④.
2. If reactive triggers fired and their host **auto-resolves** (an **inscription** — §3 "Sigils"; choices degrade to random, actor-attribution skip applies), the response resolves inline here (no halt). If matching **hand cards** offer a player response, the engine **suspends** the action — stores it as `pendingIntervention.heldAction`, records the responder's matching + affordable cards with their computed targets in `candidates` (§1 `InterventionCandidate`), sets `phase = PendingIntervention`, and opens the **set-valued** window (§4 "PendingIntervention Interruption") — emitting the responder-directed `InterventionPromptEvent` (cause = the **held action verbatim**; §3 visibility) and the public thin `InterventionWindowOpenedEvent` (§2B).
3. **Depth-1 cap (nesting only):** while an interception response is resolving, **no further *player window*** opens to halt it — but an **auto host — an inscription or a board/artifact trigger — may still fire, and even intercept, inline** (e.g. a pre-damage hero-protecting inscription firing on a `DealDamageAction` that a response enqueues), since the cap bounds only *player windows*, not reactions. (Auto-resolving reactions chain in FIFO order.) This bars a nested LIFO stack *of player windows*. It does **not** bar **iteration**: the responder may chain several of *their own* held cards against the one action — see the re-declare loop below.

**Re-declare loop (2026-06-09 — reverses the former "declared once" rule).** When a held action resumes after a **played** response, it re-enters ③ for re-validation; if still legal it is **re-published to ③′**, re-evaluating the responder's *remaining* matching + affordable cards and re-opening the window if any remain (else it proceeds to ④). The loop ends when the responder **skips** (the held action proceeds to ④), when no affordable match remains, or when re-validation **fizzles** the action (cancelled / retargeted off its subject / attacker dead — §3, §4 ③). A **skip never re-opens** the window — only a play can change the offer. The loop is bounded by the responder's next-turn mana (spent from `mana`, pre-loaded at the previous turn-end — see Turn Lifecycle), not a hard cap. See §3 for what a response may do (ordinary effects + re-resolution; only `cancel`/`retarget` touch the held action directly).

### ④ Dispatch → `IActionHandler`

The registered handler for this action type is invoked. It mutates `GameState` and returns `events[]`. This is the sole point of state mutation in the pipeline. `GameEngine` increments `GameState.currentActionEpoch` as the action enters this stage; every event the handler returns is stamped with that `originEpoch`, and any subscription the handler registers (e.g. via `ICardHandler.OnSummon`) is stamped with the same value as its `birthEpoch` — see §3 `IEventBus`. The engine also derives this action's `IRandom` from `mix(GameState.rngSeed, currentActionEpoch)`; every random outcome the handler produces is drawn from that instance (see §3 `IRandom`).

### ⑤ Publish Events → `IEventBus`

Events are published in the order returned by the handler. For each event, `IEventBus` snapshots the subscriber lists at publish time and fires them filtered by creation epoch (`birthEpoch < originEpoch`, see §3 `IEventBus`) in the canonical board order: current player's list first (minions by current board index, then their artifacts by slot, then their inscriptions by slot), then opponent's list (the same), then the neutral zone's. The epoch filter means a listener never receives an event from the action that created it. Subscribers enqueue new actions via `IActionQueue` — they do not process them inline.

### ⑥ Aura Recalculation

All registered `IAura.Calculate(state)` implementations are run. `auraAttackBonus` and `auraHealthBonus` on every minion — **including the neutral lane** — are zeroed and fully rewritten (a neutral minion stays at 0 bonus unless some aura's `Calculate` selects it; see §3 `IAura` scope note). A minion newly at ≤0 `maxHealth` (an aura-loss death) **enters pending-death** (publishing `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent`) — but it is **not removed here**; like a damage-killed minion it lingers, mortally wounded, until the next settle (⑦).

Recalculation runs **per action** (⑥, while draining) — after any action that changes board composition, minion stats, or keywords — and also after each action processed in Phase 2 of the death wave and after Phase 3 reborn summons. Keeping aura recalc per-action (cheaper than deferring it) means mid-cascade reactions always read fresh stats; only *death* is deferred to the settle, not aura math.

### ⑥′ Post-reaction Window

A checkpoint inserted after aura recalc (⑥), before the loop driver (⑨) considers the next action — the post-phase twin of ③′, and like ③′ it does **not** renumber the stages. After an action's events are published (⑤) and stats refreshed (⑥), the engine checks for **hand-card post-reactions** whose triggers matched **this action's** events:

1. The engine gathers the responder's reactive hand cards whose triggers matched **this action's** events and that are **affordable** (`effectiveCost ≤ mana`), records them — each with its computed targets — in `candidates` (§1 `InterventionCandidate`), and opens **one set-valued** `PendingIntervention` window (`phase → PendingIntervention`, `heldAction = null`) — emitting the responder-directed `InterventionPromptEvent` (cause = `causeEventIds[]`, refs to this action's matched events, already on the responder's wire from ⑤; §3 visibility) and the public thin `InterventionWindowOpenedEvent` (§2B). Each card's offered targets are its matched subjects from this action ∩ its declared `(selector, cardinality)` family.
2. **Deaths are not pre-settled here** (contrast the type-A pre-halt rule under `PendingChoice` / declaration-hold): a post-reaction is *about* what just happened, so a mortally-wounded subject must stay on the board to be acted on. ⑦ still runs only at the eventual full-drain settle.
3. The player plays **one** card — choosing it and its `cardinality` targets — or **skips**. The response **resolves immediately** (see "Response resolution"). A **play** then **re-offers** the *remaining* matching + affordable cards against the same (frozen) events with the now-current board (a card whose condition lapsed — its subject left — drops out); a **skip** ends the window. Only a play re-opens it (the **re-offer loop**, 2026-06-09).

Auto reactions (inscriptions, board/artifact triggers) do **not** open ⑥′ windows — they fired inline during ⑤ in FIFO order and enqueued their actions. Only player-choice hand cards open a ⑥′ window.

### ⑦ Death Resolution

**Settle stage — runs only when the action queue has drained to empty** (the cascade started by a top-level action has fully settled), never mid-cascade. While the queue is non-empty the engine stays in ①–⑥, so every triggered reaction resolves first and a mortally-wounded minion remains on the board (targetable, countable, keyword-active — and savable by a dying-window **save-from-lethal** intervention — a player responding to lethal damage to rescue it before removal, the "R1" avenue in amendment B) right up to this point. Then `DeathResolutionService` runs the wave loop:

1. **Collect** all minions with `currentHealth ≤ 0` or marked for destruction. Sort: current player `board[0..n]` → opponent `board[0..n]` → neutral zone by index. If none, exit loop. Otherwise publish `DeathWaveStartedEvent { waveIndex }` (0-based, incremented per wave).
2. **Phase 1 — Remove & grieve:** for each in sort order — remove from board, build a `GraveyardMinion` from its death state (`snapshot`; **no card is fabricated here** — the card form is produced lazily at point of use, §1), **route it to a graveyard**, then publish `MinionDiedEvent`. Routing reads exactly two inputs:
   - `ownerId != null` → **that player's** `graveyard` (a controlled minion — including a once-`bornNeutral` body taken over via `TakeControlAction` — grieves to its controller).
   - `bornNeutral && ownerId == null` → the shared `GameState.neutralGraveyard` (a system-spawned neutral that died in the neutral lane).
   - `!bornNeutral && ownerId == null` → **undefined, asserts** — no in-scope path creates a player-originated body in the neutral lane (`TakeControlAction` only ever moves bodies *out*). See Unaddressed Features, "A non-`bornNeutral` body dying in the neutral lane."
3. **Phase 2 — Deathrattles:** for each in sort order — call `ICardHandler.OnDeath`, which enqueues this minion's deathrattle actions. **Process the full action queue: each enqueued action is an ordinary queue citizen running the complete pipeline ①–⑥ — including its ③′/⑥′ interception windows** (so a deathrattle's `DealDamageAction` can itself be countered/redirected, and an enqueue-and-drain action sees fresh aura math; 2026-06-13, #18). New deaths during this phase are deferred to the next wave. Minions summoned during this phase are registered with the `birthEpoch` of their own `SummonMinionAction`, so the creation-epoch filter (§3 `IEventBus`) keeps them from reacting to `MinionDiedEvent`s already published in this wave — they react only to events from subsequent actions.
4. **Phase 3 — Reborns:** for each minion in the current wave with the Reborn keyword **and** `rebornAvailable == true` (in sort order) — enqueue `SummonMinionAction` at 1 HP. Process fully. Run aura recalculation. The reborn copy **keeps the Reborn keyword** but is summoned with `rebornAvailable = false`, so it cannot reborn again (if it dies it goes to graveyard normally). The keyword still counts for auras and survives bounce. A *copy* made of that spent minion is a fresh summon → `rebornAvailable` re-initializes to `true` from the keyword, so the clone reborns if it dies.
5. Publish `DeathWaveEndedEvent { waveIndex, minionsResolved }`. Back to step 1 (next wave).

**Termination — iteration cap.** The wave loop is bounded by `GameConstants.MaxDeathWaves = 16`. Reborn cannot drive an unbounded loop (it is self-consuming, step 4), so the only runaway source is Phase 2 deathrattles/summons that keep producing new deaths — almost always a card-definition bug. If the loop is about to begin a wave whose `waveIndex` would reach `MaxDeathWaves`, the engine treats this as a fatal assertion failure, **not** a game event:

1. Publish `StabilizationAbortedEvent { wavesReached, lastWaveMinionIds[] }`.
2. Publish `GameEndedEvent { winnerId: null, reason: NoContest }` and set `phase = Ended`. The match is **voided** — not a draw (a draw would unfairly affect MMR).
3. Emit a `StabilizationAbortReport` to the telemetry sink (below).

The action is **not** rolled back and replayed — rollback would restore the exact state the runaway re-triggers from, so it cannot resolve the match. Aborting the whole match is the only safe escalation. There is no rollback/snapshot dependency: the engine simply tears the match down.

This is a last-line backstop. The primary mitigation is upstream content validation at card-load time (flag obvious self-feeding patterns such as a deathrattle that summons a 0-health token); general termination is undecidable, which is why the runtime cap remains.

**`StabilizationAbortReport` (telemetry — scenario-reproducible).** Formatted so a developer can paste it directly into a `CCG.GameLogic.Tests` scenario fixture (Build → Script → Assert), guaranteeing the runaway is reproduced and the abort behavior never regresses:

```
StabilizationAbortReport {
  rngSeed:            ulong          // GameState.rngSeed; with preActionState.currentActionEpoch reproduces this action's RNG via mix(rngSeed, epoch) (see §3 IRandom)
  preActionState:     GameState      // full snapshot at the START of the triggering top-level action whose settle entered the runaway wave (carries currentActionEpoch) — the Build step
  triggeringAction:   GameAction     // the action submitted that began the runaway — the Script step
  wavesReached:       int            // = MaxDeathWaves
  cascadeTrace:       GameEvent[]     // ordered events from action start to abort — the Exact-trace Assert
}
```

A regression scenario built from a report asserts: submitting `triggeringAction` against `preActionState` (seeded with `rngSeed`) terminates at wave `MaxDeathWaves` with `StabilizationAbortedEvent` then `GameEndedEvent { NoContest }` — i.e. it aborts rather than hangs. (Re-running that scenario with an `ITraceSink` attached (§3) upgrades the event-only `cascadeTrace` to the full per-action debug view — diffs, rejections, enqueue attribution.)

### ⑧ Win Condition Check

**Settle stage — runs immediately after ⑦**, at the same queue-empty settle point. If any hero has health ≤ 0: if both ≤ 0 the game is a draw, otherwise the other player wins. `GameEndedEvent` is published and `phase` is set to `Ended`.

Mirroring ⑦'s pending-death window: a hero that crosses to ≤0 **mid-cascade** publishes **`HeroMortallyWoundedEvent`** at that moment (from the damaging action's ④), but the loss is **not** finalized until this settle — so a post-reaction save (heal-above-0 / immune, §3) enqueued onto the still-draining queue resolves first, and ⑧ then re-reads actual hero health and finds it survived. This gives heroes the same dying-window the death wave gives minions; simultaneous mutual lethality still settles here as a draw.

### ⑨ Dequeue / Drive Loop

The loop driver. **If the action queue is non-empty**, pull the next action and return to ① (continue draining the cascade through ①–⑥, including ⑥′). **If the queue is empty**, run the settle stages ⑦ (death wave) then ⑧ (win check); the death wave may enqueue actions (deathrattles, reborns), so if the queue is non-empty again, resume draining — otherwise the cascade is fully settled and the engine awaits the next player action. (A player-submitted action is just the next thing dequeued, starting a fresh cascade.)

Post-reaction windows are **not** opened here at the settle; they open **per action at ⑥′**, immediately after each triggering action. A save therefore resolves right after its cause — well before the eventual ⑦/⑧ — so it can lift a mortally-wounded minion back above 0 before any death wave collects it, without waiting for or racing against the full-cascade settle.

---

### Match Setup

Runs **once**, before the first turn, when the second player connects (the `WaitingForPlayers` → `Mulligan` transition — ② phase-guard). All randomness is seeded from `rngSeed` via `IRandom` (§3), so setup is replay-exact. Bracketed values are `GameConstants` (the single source).

1. **Players & heroes.** Both `PlayerState`s are built from their decklists. Each hero starts at `StartingHeroHealth` (30) health **and** max (the `HealAction` cap, #12), `armor = 0`, `mana = maxMana = 0`, `fatigueCounter = 0`. Each player is equipped the shared **starter artifact** via `EquipArtifactAction` (§2A).
2. **Deck assertion & shuffle.** The engine asserts each decklist is exactly `DeckSize` (30) cards within `MaxCopiesPerCard` (2; 1 per Legendary) — primarily server-side deck validation, asserted here as a guard — then Fisher-Yates-shuffles each deck over `IRandom`.
3. **First player.** A seeded coin flip picks who goes first.
4. **Opening hands.** Deal `StartingHandFirstPlayer` (3) to the first player, `StartingHandSecondPlayer` (4) to the second. **Guaranteed opening card (deck-build pin):** a decklist may flag **one** `guaranteedOpeningCardKey`; after the shuffle, if no copy of that `definitionKey` already lies within the player's opening-hand slice, the engine **swaps the top-most copy into the opening hand** — a pure post-shuffle position swap that consumes **no** `IRandom`, so the remaining deal is unbiased and replay stays exact. The pin guarantees only the initial deal — the card carries **no** mulligan protection (it can be replaced like any other). Optional (a deck may have none).
5. **The Coin.** The second player additionally receives **The Coin** — a 0-cost card whose effect enqueues `ModifyManaAction { delta = +1 }` (the going-second equalizer; it may push `mana` above `maxMana`, §2A #22). This stands in for HS's temporary mana crystal, which this model does not have.
6. **Opening-hand sigil registration.** Because the opening hand is dealt **here**, outside the action pipeline, any reactive (sigil) cards in it register their hand-zone triggers **at setup with `birthEpoch = 0`** (the match-start epoch) — *not* in the `DrawCardAction`/`GiveCardAction` handler, which covers only in-game additions. They are live for invocation from turn 1.
7. **Mulligan (HS-faithful).** `phase → Mulligan`; each player sees their own opening hand (directed `MulliganStartedEvent`, own options only) and may replace **any subset** (`SubmitMulliganAction { cardIdsToKeep[] }` — the complement is replaced). The **replacement cards are drawn first**, *then* the replaced cards are shuffled back into the deck — so a replaced card cannot be immediately redrawn. Both `MulliganCompletedEvent`s in (`mulliganState` both-complete) ends the phase.
8. **Turn 1.** Seed the first player's `mana = maxMana = StartingMana` (1) **directly** — there is no preceding turn-end refresh (Turn Lifecycle step 4 note); `phase → InProgress`; begin turn 1. The neutral lane is **empty** until its first Interturn handover (end of turn 3 — `NeutralZoneConfig.firstSpawnTurn`).

---

### Turn Lifecycle

The `EndTurnAction` handler and subsequent system actions implement the full turn transition:

1. Publish `TurnEndedEvent`
2. Fire End-of-Turn triggers (current player L→R, then opponent L→R) — **neutral minions are intentionally excluded** (turn-scoped; a neutral minion has no turn of its own — see §3 `IEventBus`)
3. **Unfreeze sweep — for the player whose turn is ENDING** (before the swap, so the freeze actually costs an attack rather than thawing at the start of the controller's turn): thaw each frozen minion they control **unless** it was frozen *this* turn while exhausted — i.e. keep frozen iff `frozenOnTurn == turn.number && attacksUsedThisTurn >= budget` (the same exhaustion test as `AttackerExhausted`, §4 ③); otherwise set `isFrozen = false`, clear `frozenOnTurn`, emit `MinionThawedEvent`. This makes Freeze cost exactly one attack (a minion frozen after swinging stays frozen through its next turn; one frozen on the opponent's turn, or this turn before swinging, thaws at the end of the turn it was unable to act). Minions only — heroes have no frozen state (§1).
4. **Mana refresh — for the player whose turn is ENDING** (moved from turn-start to turn-**end**, 2026-06-09): increment *their* `maxMana` (cap 10) and restore *their* `mana` to `maxMana`. Refreshing here pre-loads the full pool the player then carries **through the opponent's turn**, so an off-turn **intervention** spends straight from `mana` (the ordinary `effectiveCost ≤ mana` check) and the player's own next turn simply begins with whatever interventions didn't consume — **no `reservedMana` field, no separate ceiling**; the affordability ceiling is naturally their *full ramped* next-turn pool. (The game's first turn has no preceding turn-end, so game setup seeds each player's turn-1 `mana`/`maxMana` directly. A future overload-style "less mana next turn" effect would apply its reduction here.)
5. **Interturn — the neutral lane's "turn" (`activePlayerId = none`).** Runs after the ending player's cleanup and before the swap, owned by **neither** player. For its duration `turn.activePlayerId` is **none** (null): with no active player, neither player's trigger groups fire — **only the neutral group does** (§3 `IEventBus`), the exact dual of neutral minions being excluded from player turns. **Repopulation:** if `neutralZoneConfig != null` **and** `turn.number ≥ neutralZoneConfig.firstSpawnTurn` (default 3 — the end of P1's second turn), **refill the neutral lane to `maxCapacity`** by enqueuing `SpawnNeutralMinionAction { definitionKey = null }` × (`maxCapacity − currentCount`) — each draws its definition from `spawnPool` at its own ④ `IRandom` and emits `MinionSummonedEvent { ownerId = null }`; the batch is bracketed by `NeutralZoneRepopulatedEvent` (renderer marker). The first qualifying handover finds an empty lane and **seeds** full capacity; every later one **tops it up** — initial seed and recurring refill are one rule, no special branch. **Consequence:** a player's board-wide on-summon (or other) reaction does **not** fire on a handover spawn — the neutral lane's turn is walled off from both players (a neutral *card-spawned on a player's turn* still triggers player reactions normally; only the handover is walled). No-op before `firstSpawnTurn` or when the lane is already full. **Reserved seam:** the Interturn step is the *only* owned-by-neither, fair-dispatch, once-per-handover point in the loop; neutral repopulation is v1's sole inhabitant (other candidates — neutral-minion upkeep, environmental/round effects, shared-resource ticks — recorded in the borrow-list note).
6. **Advance the active player** to the incoming player (out of the Interturn `none` state — the one who did *not* just end their turn)
7. Clear `summoningSick` (wake) and reset `attacksUsedThisTurn` on all of the new active player's minions
8. Reset `cardsPlayedThisTurn`; reset `usesThisTurn` on each of the new active player's artifacts (re-arms escalating activation costs — §1 `ArtifactOnBoard`)
9. Enqueue `DrawCardAction`
10. Publish `TurnStartedEvent`
11. Fire Start-of-Turn triggers (new active player L→R, then opponent L→R) — neutral minions excluded (turn-scoped; step 2)
12. Start turn timer

Each of these produces actions that go through the full pipeline.

---

### Response resolution (both window kinds)

Whenever a window's response is submitted, the response's effects **resolve to completion immediately** — the engine processes the response's enqueued actions (and any inline board/auto reactions they chain, FIFO) **fully, before returning to drain the pre-existing queue.** Then the window **loops**: a declaration-hold resumes its `heldAction` (re-validated ②③) and, if still legal, **re-declares (③′)**; a post-reaction **re-offers** its remaining matched set at ⑥′. The loop re-opens **iff the response played a card** — which shrinks the offer and may change the board; a **skip** changes nothing and so **terminates** the loop (a declaration-hold's `heldAction` proceeds to ④; a post-reaction's cascade resumes). Each played card pays `effectiveCost` from the responder's `mana` (their next-turn pool, pre-loaded at turn-end — Turn Lifecycle); when nothing affordable remains, the loop ends.

Immediate resolution is **load-bearing, not an optimization**: were the response merely FIFO-appended behind the rest of the cascade, an already-queued `PendingChoice` or declaration-hold could pre-settle deaths (⑦) and remove the very minion a save just targeted, before the heal lands. The **depth-1 cap** applies **within** a response — while it resolves, its own sub-actions open no further *player* windows (③′ and ⑥′ are suppressed); **board/auto triggers still fire inline**. The cap bars only **nesting** (a further *player window* on a response), never **iteration** (the loop re-opening the *same* responder's window after the response completes) and never inline reactions — an auto host may even *intercept* a response's own sub-action inline (e.g. a pre-damage inscription on damage the response deals).

### PendingChoice Interruption

When an effect issues `StartChoiceAction`:
- **Pre-halt death rule (amendment B) — type-A halts only:** before halting, Death Resolution (⑦) runs to settle any pending deaths, so the player never acts against a board where mortally-wounded minions still linger. This applies to **`PendingChoice` and declaration-hold interventions** alike — both are halts about a player's own *forward* action, where lingering pending-death minions are noise. It does **not** apply to post-reaction windows (⑥′), which are *about* the just-happened events and must keep their mortally-wounded subjects on board.
- `GamePhase` → `PendingChoice`
- Remaining effect actions (the continuation) are serialised into `PendingChoice.context`
- Pipeline halts — no further actions are processed until the choice resolves
- `SubmitChoiceAction` arrives → selected option is filled into the continuation → continuation actions re-enqueued → `GamePhase` → `InProgress`

### PendingIntervention Interruption

A window **opened by live reactive triggers on hand cards** that matched (§3 "Reactive Triggers, Interventions & Interception") — never a general engine rule. It is **set-valued** (offers *all* the responder's matching + affordable cards in `candidates`, each with its engine-computed targets — §1 `InterventionCandidate`) and **loops** by re-opening after each play; it resolves one of two ways, by which phase the triggers hooked. (Throughout: `phase → PendingIntervention`; `candidates` lists the offer; the responder-directed `InterventionPromptEvent` + public thin `InterventionWindowOpenedEvent` go out (§2B); timeout timer starts; only `SubmitInterventionAction` from the responding player is accepted — **exempt** from the ③ turn-ownership check, its cost paid from the responder's `mana` (their next-turn pool, pre-loaded at turn-end — Turn Lifecycle); a **play** re-opens the window over the remaining offer, a **skip / timeout** ends the loop; timeout = an injected skip, logged as an input per Item 13; `phase → InProgress` at the end.)

**Declaration-hold (pre-phase — `heldAction` present).** Opened at ③′ when hand triggers fire on `ActionDeclaredEvent`. The triggering action is suspended into `pendingIntervention.heldAction`.
- On **play**: the chosen card resolves first (full pipeline, paying `effectiveCost` from `mana`); it runs ordinary effects (summon, grant keyword, gain armor, …) and may `cancel` or `retarget` the held action. The held action then **resumes, re-validated (②③)**: if `cancel`led or now illegal (attacker dead/returned, target gone, forced to a Taunt) it **fizzles** — dropped, not executed (no `ActionRejection`; no client awaits it) — and the loop ends; if still legal it **re-declares (③′)**, re-opening the **set-valued** window over the responder's *remaining* matching + affordable cards (the **re-declare loop**), or, if none remain, proceeding to ④. The responder may thus chain several of their *own* held cards (bounded by next-turn mana); a response is never intervened on *itself* (depth-1).
- On **skip / timeout**: the loop ends — the held action resumes, re-validates, and executes (④) or fizzles. The window does **not** re-open (a skip changes nothing).

**Post-reaction (post-phase — `heldAction` null).** Hand triggers that fire on regular events (including the cadence-deferred `MinionMortallyWoundedEvent` / `HeroMortallyWoundedEvent`) do **not** halt per-event. The matching events of **one action** are gathered and a **set-valued** window opens at **⑥′** — immediately after that action's ⑤/⑥ (see "Batching"), *not* deferred to the full-cascade settle. Because ⑦ runs only at the eventual settle, the mortally-wounded subject is still on the board when the window opens, so a save (heal a mortally-wounded minion or hero back above 0) lands before any death wave collects it. **Post-reaction windows never pre-settle deaths** — the subject must remain on board for the response to act on, and the wave simply does not collect a minion the response lifted back above 0. The response resolves immediately (see "Response resolution"); a **play re-offers** the remaining matching + affordable set (the **re-offer loop**); a **skip / timeout** ends the window and the cascade resumes. There is no held action to resume.

**Batching — two granularities: the offered card set, and each card's target set.** (1) *Across cards* — the window is **set-valued**: it offers every reactive hand card of the responder that matched **this action** and is affordable; the player plays one or skips, and a play re-offers the rest (above). (2) *Within a card* — a single AoE produces many sub-events (one selector-carrying `DealDamageAction` → many `DamageTakenEvent`s, one per target), so a card's offered **targets** are its matched subjects from this action **∩ its declared `(selector, cardinality)` family** (the family's `All…/Alive…/Dead…` choice decides whether a mortally-wounded match is offered — inclusive for a "save" card). The triggering unit is therefore **one action's events** — never one event, never the whole cascade. `SubmitInterventionAction` carries `{chosenCardId, targetIds[]}`, validated by the ordinary §4 ③ membership check (`chosenCardId ∈ candidates`, `targetIds ⊆` that candidate's `targetIds`).

- **AoE, one save card → one card in the offer, all N subjects as its targets.** An AoE damaging **7** friendly minions while the responder holds a single "heal one minion +2 on `DamageTakenEvent`" card → the window offers that one card over all 7 (the dying ones included); pick one to heal/save.
- **Two separate damage instances (two actions) → two windows.** A card dealing 1 twice via two `DealDamageAction`s opens a window after each; a single-use reactive may be spent on **either** — **skip** the first (which ends *that* window's loop but does **not** consume or discard the card — it stays in hand, trigger registered) to hold for the second, or spend immediately. Distinct instances, not the AoE case.
- **Multiple reactive cards on one action → one set-valued window**, re-offered on each play; the responder chooses order by which card they pick each pass. (This replaces the former "one window per matched card in hand order"; replay determinism comes from the logged `SubmitInterventionAction` choices, not an engine-imposed card order.)

Declaration-hold windows are likewise **set-valued + looped**: each declared action is a single `ActionDeclaredEvent`, so a "counter the spell" card hooks the one `ResolveCardAction` (the resolution — true Counterspell; a "prevent the cast" card hooks the earlier `PlayCardAction` instead, §2A #34), a "redirect the spell" card hooks whichever it targets, and a **pre-damage** card hooks the AoE's **single selector-carrying `DealDamageAction`** (§3 `ITargetSelector` auto-hit) — one window for the whole AoE either way, fired at ③′ *before* the hits rather than at ⑥′ *after* them, and re-declared after each play.

Only **player-choice windows** open this way; **auto reactions** (inscriptions, board/artifact triggers) fire inline per-event in FIFO during ⑤ (and during a response — the depth-1 cap suppresses only player windows). A deterministic reaction with no decision (e.g. "heal *it* for 2", no target choice) is the natural **inscription** (or board-hosted trigger), enqueuing one effect per match and opening no window at all.

## Unaddressed Features

Features the current architecture **deliberately does not support** and that are deferred **indefinitely** (no planned epic/ticket, unlike the "deferred to a future epic" items tracked in the borrow-list/plan). Each entry records the limitation, why it exists, and what enabling it would cost — so a future card requirement can reopen it with full context rather than rediscovering the constraint.

> **Note (keyword model collapse):** an earlier entry here — *"aura-granted active keywords"* — has been **removed**, not deferred. It existed because keywords were split into declarative (queried) and active (event-bus listeners), and an aura granting a listener-backed keyword would have had to subscribe during stage-⑥ recalc, violating the Item 3 invariant. The active/listener category was eliminated (§3 `IKeyword`): all keywords are declarative, pulled from the effective view at the minion's own action moments, with follow-on actions expressed as role-interface hooks. Aura-granted keywords now behave identically to intrinsic ones with no special mechanism, so the limitation no longer exists.

### Keyword effects on a dead source

A minion's **keyword hooks (Lifesteal, Poisonous, …) do not apply to damage its own Deathrattle deals after it has died.** The damage is still *attributed* to the dead minion (`sourceId` on the event, so watching triggers and friendly/enemy checks resolve correctly — see §3 "Source Attribution"), but the keyword *effects* don't fire.

- **Why:** keyword hooks read the acting minion's **effective** keywords from live board state (§3 `IKeyword`). A dead source has left the board (death-wave Phase 1) before its Deathrattle resolves (Phase 2), so `EffectiveKeywords(source)` is empty. No special-casing.
- **"Dead" here means *removed*, not *mortally wounded* (amendment B):** a minion at ≤0 HP that is still on the board (pending death, before the settle) is *fully keyword-active* — if it deals damage in that window (e.g. a dying-swing retaliation), its Lifesteal/Poisonous etc. *do* fire, because `EffectiveKeywords(source)` reads it from the live board. The limitation applies only once the death wave's Phase 1 has actually removed the source.
- **Cost to enable:** a death-snapshot fallback — when the source is dead, the relevant handler reads keywords off the source's `GraveyardMinion.snapshot` instead of live board state. A localized fallback in the affected handlers, not a parallel mechanism.
- **Status:** no card in scope needs it. Revisit only when one does.

### A non-`bornNeutral` body dying in the neutral lane

The §4 ⑦ Phase-1 graveyard-routing rule reads exactly two inputs — `bornNeutral` (origin) and `ownerId` (lane) — and defines **two** destinations: `bornNeutral && ownerId == null` → the shared neutral graveyard; `ownerId != null` → that player's graveyard. The third combination, **`!bornNeutral && ownerId == null`** (a *player-originated* body dying *in* the neutral lane), is **deliberately left undefined** — it routes to neither, and the engine treats reaching it as an assertion gap rather than silently picking a graveyard.

- **Why it can't happen yet:** nothing in scope moves a player-originated minion into the neutral lane. `bornNeutral` is set **only** by the system `SpawnNeutralMinionAction`; control (`TakeControlAction`) only ever moves bodies *out* of the lane (into a player's board, giving them an `ownerId`), never in.
- **What would reach it (signalled, not committed):** a future **"release a player minion to neutral"** effect, or a **"player card that summons into the neutral lane."** Both produce a body that is in the neutral lane (`ownerId == null`) yet not `bornNeutral`.
- **Cost to enable:** an **owner-of-record** on the minion (the controller it should grieve back to when it dies neutral) — a new nullable field plus a routing branch. Intentionally **not** added now: there is no field to populate and no card to populate it, so adding it would be speculative.
- **Status:** open by design. Whoever introduces a player→neutral path owns defining this branch.

### Hero combat (RESOLVED 2026-06-11 — concept dropped)

The former "Freezing a hero" and "Hero armor" entries lived here. Both closed by the hero-kit decision (2026-06-11): **heroes never attack** — no `heroAttack`, no weapons (the `Weapon` card type is gone), no hero frozen state (freeze has nothing to deny a hero — `FreezeTargetAction` is minion-only); the hero's kit is the **artifact row** (§1). Hero **armor** was kept and landed: `PlayerState.armor`, `GainArmorAction`/`ArmorGainedEvent`, and the §4 ④ absorb slot (`DamageTakenEvent.armorAbsorbed`). Heroes remain attackable *defenders* and never retaliate — structurally, since retaliation is gated on the defender's attack (> 0) and a hero has none.
